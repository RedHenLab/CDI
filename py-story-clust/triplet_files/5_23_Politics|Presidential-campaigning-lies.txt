they | re | part of every presidential race 
John McCain | stack | this time 
Great | to be | you Randi 
Lets | just start | the top 
we | ve seen | this campaign season 
these candidates | have made | gaffes 
the other | to become known | the one 
| used | this idea 
that Al Gore | said | he 
the internet | to really paint | Al Gore 
he | said | so that 
let | try and set | the record 
which | got | a lot of attention 
the gas tax holiday | would cost | about as much 
that bridge | to nowhere | Alaska 
he | said | we 
Washington | greeted | proposal 
we | know | The fascinating thing to me 
that $ million bridge | to nowhere | Alaska 
he | has actually said | they 
he | would pay | the gas tax holiday 
the IRS | has estimated eliminating | the gas tax 
the summer | would cost | the federal treasury $ billion 
John McCain | inflating | two things 
Lets | get | one more here 
McCain | took | a lot of heat 
Barack Obama | had to say | McCain 
We | are bogged down | a war 
we | re there | years 
they | care | about is 
He | told | CBSs Face the Nation 
a little | built | a gaffe 
he | has said | many times 
he | would be ok | a continued presence of U.S. military forces 
Iraq | was sort | peace time presence 
the way McCain | put | the way 
moveon.org which | quickly put | an ad suggesting 
John McCain | wanted | a year war 
we | have | time 
John McCain | suggesting | Barack Obama 
He | s calling | John McCain suggesting that Barack Obama wants to attack and bomb Pakistan . 
he | wants to bomb | Pakistan 
Let | hear | what Obama 
terrorists | holed | those mountains 
a terrible mistake | to fail to act when | we 
a chance | to take | an al Qaeda leadership meeting 
we | had | actionable intelligence 
END VIDEO CLIP | sounded | that way 
Barack Obama | wants to bomb | Pakistan 
END VIDEO CLIP | is probably | most of your viewers 
He | s saying rather | he 
Pakistans president | did not help | the U.S. 
McCain | has | a purpose 
Barack Obama | is | military affairs 
sort of help | set | our viewers 
they | re really saying | all this distortion
