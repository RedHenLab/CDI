the mystery and magic of what | had once been known | the Forbidden City 
we | are now closing | the end of this Friday 
the opening ceremony | beginning | p.m. 
the opening | began | another number 
A series of fireworks | going | a footprint pattern 
more than spectators | watched | this open ceremony 
The local people | here counting | the clock 
the USA | looked | mighty dapper 
he | took | the spectacle 
we | have | time 
all the things | going | around 
just a moment | was really | something 
We | re going to come back | we
