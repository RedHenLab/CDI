He | was | one of the Lost Boys 
he | lives south | Syracuse 
a church | surrounded | a cornfield 
the people of Tully | get | a gold medal 
Hundreds of people | showed | Saint Leos Church 
whose Olympic dreams | are unfolding | Hundreds of people eyes 
Kind | to see | a kid 
competitions | sat | the back 
whatever | was going | school 
small town | mingling | a mission 
the Olympic games | to raise | money 
we | ll have to have | a fundraiser 
a fundraiser | s | a good economy 
we | talked | once 
everyone | said | once 
the guest of honor | was | the other side of the world 
he | was | the party 
he | was | the phone 
the former | Lost | Boy 
Tully | will be tuned | the games 
Lomong | goes | gold 
this town | going to be rooting when | that gun 
Lopez | wins | the gold medal 
the story of his incredible life | goes | the Sudan 
someone | to write | the movie
