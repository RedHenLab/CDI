Let | go | Georgia 
some degree | remains | limbo even 
this moment | is virtually | the city limits of that flash point city 
Russian special forces troops | were right here | they 
we | can confirm | confusing and contradictory reports 
this untold number of reports | s going | the city 
journalists and others | have attempted to enter | the city 
the Russians | have put | a firm roadblock 
Now | s preventing | any entry 
President Bush | has stated categorically | the U.S. 
Russia | to maintain | the lines of communication 
this major artery | inhibits | access 
that humanitarian aid | would most | likely use 
the Russian forces | are firmly | control of the Georgian city 
this one | being | South Ossetia 
Gori | is actually | Georgian country 
we | ve been hearing | reports 
the last two or three hours of explosions | rocking | the city of Gori 
anything | s been happening as far | those explosions 
a number of dark smoke flames | are arriving | the area of the city 
we | re hearing | both sides 
those explosions | are controlled | detonations of munitions 
the approach | leading | this city 
more than perhaps a brigade | s amassed | the Russian army 
Tbilisi | is well | the Russians 
we | ve seen are | no position
