China | was determined to give | Beijing 
towers of glass and steel and streets | lined | millions of flowers 
just what communist officials | want | an Olympic television audience 
the shadow of modern high rises | hidden | a wall 
Hu Jian Jun | lives | a year old house 
Hu Jian Jun | has been demolished to make | way 
Mr. Jun | delayed | construction 
they | want to hide | things 
he | told | me 
They | want | people 
he | means | the government 
They | were | this neighborhood 
which | is slated | destruction 
They | re | love 
This ancient capital | seems to be getting younger | the day 
some | would call | character
