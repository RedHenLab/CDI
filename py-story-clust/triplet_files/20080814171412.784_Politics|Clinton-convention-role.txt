we | have learned | Hillary Clinton 
Hillary Rodham Clintons name | will be placed | nomination 
A party source | tells | CNN 
the best way | to soothe | the wounds 
nomination | would be | a catharsis 
Clinton | is campaigning | Obama 
We | can see | Iowa City 
We | can see | the background 
part of the statement | answer | BRIANNA KEILAR 
me | read | part of the statement 
We | have | a little bit of a delay 
every voice | heard | the party 
we | will elect | Senator Obama president of the United States 
nomination | unify | the party 
the question | s always been | the concern 
the convention | expose | the division 
They | had to go | all the way 
the super delegates | were almost certainly going to vote | mass 
Hillary Clinton | should get | percent of the delegate votes 
Michigan and Florida | are allowed to vote | full strength 
the historic statement | is made | a woman 
the party | will unify | Barack Obama 
the risk | will provide | some drama 
They | re having | a discussion 
many | votes | Clinton 
many | votes | Obama 
we | ll just see | the tally of the votes 
Now | will happen | this time 
the delegates | stand up | a roll 
we | re going to miss | Guam 
No one | does | No one
