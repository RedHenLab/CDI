LRB | JOINED | PROGRESS 
the events | preceded | the whole invasion and occupation 
Georgia | was denied | membership action plan 
April | was asking | trouble 
they | told | the world 
they | are denying | Georgia membership action plan 
one | could say | the Russians 
the Russians | perceive | Bucharest 
some of the western commentators | made | fun of me 
Russia | perceives | the Russians 
Bucharest | was perceived | some of the western commentators 
they | started to build | the infrastructure 
they | started to bring | railway troops 
They | build | tank bases 
We | told | the world 
They | started to bring | lots of military specialists 
They | brought | in paratroopers 
we | scream | the world 
Russians | were carefully watching | this reaction 
They | were doing | step 
we | were standing | here last time 
we | do nt believe | Just exactly in the lines of self position LRB ph RRB . 
Russians | would deny | the past 
they | watched | the European reactions 
No European country | said | anything 
those people | perpetrate | those 
those people | failed to stop | this arrogance 
Georgians | might have started | now 
Twelve hundred tanks | came | Georgia 
no way | can mobilize | those tanks 
ph | RRB taken | the streets of Moscow 
they | were not preparing | an invasion 
they | call | the pensioners 
My defense minister | was gone | a holiday 
Most of the decision makers | tried to reach were gone | vacations 
we | are looking | evil 
the next chapters | write | this historic new chapter of the world 
will Georgia | reconcile | occupation of even one square kilometer 
a strong force | led | former KGB warriors 
Those tanks | were taken out | Afghanistan 
Georgia | was | the first one 
they | are | the roll 
Russia | claimed | Georgia 
We | were | years of communist mud 
former KGB people | were gone | good 
Georgia | will succumb | people like former KGB people pressures 
we | will give | our freedom and independence 
freedom | will go | every part of Georgia 
we | will definitely get rid | these invaders 
Troops | must leave | today 
Today | signed | the cease fire agreement 
We | are | Russian invasion 
we | want to end | Russian invasion and occupation 
we | should move | this temporary arrangement 
the ground | to replace | the occupiers and people 
Human Rights Watch | saying | Russia 
they | used | weapons of massive destruction 
We | saw | SS 
an upgraded version of SS | were withdrawn | Europe 
They | are now using | local civilians 
They | ve used | now 
those people | write | these articles 
Russian payroll | to say | just anything 
people | would justify | anything Stalin 
people | to justify | anything Hitler 
an unprovoked brutal invasion and attack | to kill | Georgian democracy 
we | will deter | the Europeans 
we | have | a good agreement 
We | have got | lots of solidarity 
We | will increase | western economic and other presence 
my country | to shine and go back | its feet 
a country | has | the lowest corruption rate 
the region | according | the World Bank 
which | has | the highest 
which | moved | th something place 
we | were | par 
which | had been bombed | cluster bombs 
Doctors | were | place 
Russia | has | lots of tanks 
| will never repeat | itself 
President Bush | noted | his statement 
he | has sent | me 
We | support | Georgias sovereignty 
We | support | its independence 
We | support | its territorial integrity 
We | support | its democracy 
Georgia | had | profound implications 
France | has brokered | a six part cease fire accord 
the understanding | had | President Sarkozy 
which | is | President Saakashvili 
place | take | place 
we | need | international observers 
we | need | a more robust and impartial peacekeeping international force 
the monitors | could come | Georgia 
Russian cooperation | getting | those monitors 
The United States and others | are already providing | humanitarian assistance 
Access | must be | those humanitarian efforts 
we | will turn immediately | reconstruction 
people | are displaced | others homes 
He | directed | Secretary of Defense Robert Gates 
mission | is now | way 
We | ve started | work 
the Georgian government | have engaged | the G 
other international financial institutions | to rapidly develop | an economic support package 
the Georgian economy | to build | its demonstrated track record 
We | anticipate | this package 
The package | should restore | Georgias economy 
Russian forces | need to leave | Georgia 
The world | needs to help | Georgia 
a great power | invaded | a small neighbor 
The free world | will now have to wrestle | the profound implications of this Russian attack 
We | ll be taking | two questions 
Russian forces | are to leave | Georgian territory 
the president | has received | some clarifications 
the document | known | Point Five 
what temporary measures | can be | place 
we | have been talking | Foreign Minister 
Finnish Foreign Minister Stubb | getting | those monitors 
they | will come | some fruition 
we | will have to have | measures 
international peacekeeping forces | are | the conflict 
the position of the United States that that will have to that will require international peacekeeping forces that are neutral in the conflict | will have to be | a part of further discussions 
the region | can say | we 
Only the government of Georgia | has | legitimate right 
or not | to tolerate | the presence of any other foreign force 
we | agreed | a cease fire 
We | need to end | this thing 
we | need to end | killing 
we | will only agree | durable solutions 
the last thing I want to say Madame Secretary we have a good agreement on rebuilding Georgia infrastructure economy | includes really | impartial force 
they | are there | the peacekeeping 
they | re basically keeping | the territories 
We | need | genuine reconciliation 
we | need | long term process 
we | need | negotiations 
the Russians | was never | those territories 
all | taking | the rest of the country 
the Russians | was always | leverage 
Second | came | those territories 
Czechoslovakia | had to give | LRB 
other countries | had to give | a piece of their territory and 
no way today anybody | can impose | such solutions 
the United States | is not going | the United States 
No European nation | will ever go | No European nation 
The Security Council of the U.N. I hope never | is why | we 
we | need negotiating | solutions 
anything | will be | just international criminal activity 
the whole world | reacts | international criminal activity 
this agreement | protects | Georgian interests 
the level of support | ve had | Western allies 
Russia | will not be tolerated | the future 
they | told | me 
they | ve dropped LRB | ph RRB cluster bombs 
they | mocked | LRB ph RRB 
they | are | doing 
all | opening | your eyes 
Russia | has been | all the time 
we | got where | we 
some durable mechanism | to deter | about the future 
about the future | s going to replicate | itself 
extremely arrogant and euphoric forces | thinks | they 
they | can do | things 
We | need to do | our utmost 
we | are having | a talk 
ph | RRB | the streets of my towns and roads 
we | can reconcile | the fact 
population | was | almost people 
less than | are left | continuous Russians actions 
we | ll never reconcile | the fact 
some of the journalists | have seen | one fact 
we | build | schools 
all | destroyed | barbarians 
we | build | amusement park 
we | build | LRB 
we | build | concert hall 
we | build | Olympic sized pool 
We | build | schools and hospitals 
all of this | shattered | all of this 
nice and new | makes | These 
the people | despise | everything 
they | re up | to 
we | ve been building | these concert halls 
we | ve been bringing | the famous rock groups 
the West | to tell | the famous rock groups 
we | have to sit | the trenches 
They | decided to kill | our music 
They | leveled | city of Tskhinvali 
Georgian troops | behaved how | these barbarians 
we | know exactly | the truth 
we | know | we 
people | have tried | These best 
the United States | will be | its allies 
no NATO | will remain | European democracies 
we | will also have to begin | a discussion 
President Bush | put | a discussion of as I said the consequences of what Russia has done 
he | said | the Russians 
what role Russia | intends to play | international politics 
the president | have spent | most of the time today 
Georgias interests | are protected | this cease fire agreement 
the Georgian president | admitted | himself
