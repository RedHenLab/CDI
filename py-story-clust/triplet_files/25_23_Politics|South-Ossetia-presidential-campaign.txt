George Bushs controversy | to take | care

Bob Kagan | was | one 
John McCain | seeing | John McCain 
he | s understood | Putin 
Obama | was | first 
these situations | remind | you of what 
Barack Obama | had sent | Susan Rice 
others | would be rightly condemning | Barack Obama making waves and heading back .
