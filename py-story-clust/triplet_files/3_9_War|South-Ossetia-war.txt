we | ve been following | all morning 
We | want to get | our State Department correspondent 
Spokesman Gonzo Gallegos | issued | this statement 
We | support | Georgias territorial integrity and call 
We | urge | all parties 
We | re working | mediation efforts 
We | re sending | an envoy 
the region | to engage | the conflict 
the U.S. | is taking | the situation 
They | do not want | all out war 
Russia and Georgia | to destabilize | the region 
a really key point | to understand | all of this 
Georgia | provides | a practical route 
Georgia s | avoids | Iran 
Azerbaijan | goes | Turkey 
Turkey | s where | all the oil 
tankers | get | Europe 
all of that | has to pass | Georgia 
Something like probably up to a million barrels of oil a day | is | that reason 
a situation | destabilizes | the entire region
