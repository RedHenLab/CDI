the kind of retirement | has given | todays CNNs Hero 
a girl | reaches | the age 
she | can help | the house 
the mother | starts keeping | this girl 
That girl | begins missing | school 
We | want to take | the Senegal 
We | take | girls 
They | learn how | perfect a skill 
We | have | the pastry shops 
they | make | sheets 
they | make | dolls 
they | make | any kind of household linens 
Half of the funds | goes back | girls who have already failed in school 
The other remainder | goes | the education program 
We | do | the time 
They | are passing | schools 
They | are opening | businesses 
we | have | seven girls 
they | run | everything 
the best job | have ever had | my life 
The most outstanding CNN heroes | will be honored | an all star tribute
