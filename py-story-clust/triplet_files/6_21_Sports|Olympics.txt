they | will go again | Tuesday night 
they | call | themselves 
some redemption | struggling to | only a bronze medal 
the swimmer | had fallen | the water 
next hour | is just | a rule 
a rule | can not re enter | the water 
the ball | has bounced | second time 
We | re going to talk | an Olympic reunion 
A couple of American heroes | head back | the Games
