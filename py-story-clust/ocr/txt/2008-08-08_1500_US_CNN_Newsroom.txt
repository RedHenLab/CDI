CCO|20080808151321.007|THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR MANY,
CCO|20080808151322.852|MANY YEARS.
CCO|20080808151324.698|YOU HAVE TO WONDER, THOUGH, WHY 
OTS|20080808151332
CCO|20080808151326.543|IS GEORGIA SO IMPORTANT TO THE

CCO|20080808151332.078|>> Reporter: WELL, GEORGIA IS A

CCO|20080808151335.769|COUNTRY TO THE U.S. AS WELL AS

OTS|20080808151342
CCO|20080808151339.459|IT IS A MAJOR TRANSIT POINT OF 
CCO|20080808151341.304|OIL, A REALLY KEY POINT TO 
CCO|20080808151343.149|UNDERSTAND IN ALL OF THIS.
CCO|20080808151344.995|GEORGIA PROVIDES A PRACTICAL 
CCO|20080808151346.840|ROUTE TO GET OIL THAT BASICALLY 
OTS|20080808151352
CCO|20080808151348.685|AVOIDS RUSSIA, AVOIDS IRAN.
CCO|20080808151350.530|WHAT THE KEY IS IS THAT THERE'S 
CCO|20080808151352.375|A PIPELINE THAT GOES TO TURKEY 
OTS|20080808151402
CCO|20080808151354.221|AND IN TURKEY IS WHERE ALL OF 
CCO|20080808151356.066|THE OIL IS LOADED ONTO TANKERS 
CCO|20080808151357.911|THAT EVENTUALLY GET TO EUROPE 
CCO|20080808151359.756|AND THE U.S.
CCO|20080808151401.601|AND ALL OF THAT HAS TO PASS 
CCO|20080808151403.446|THROUGH GEORGIA, JUST A SHORT

CCO|20080808151408.982|TO A MILLION BARRELS OF OIL A 
CCO|20080808151410.827|DAY IS PUMPED.
CCO|20080808151412.672|THAT'S SOMETHING LIKE MORE THAN 
OTS|20080808151422
CCO|20080808151414.518|1% OF WORLD OIL SUPPLIES.
CCO|20080808151416.363|SO IT'S SIGNIFICANT FOR THAT 
CCO|20080808151418.208|REASON, BUT ALSO IT'S A

CCO|20080808151423.744|AND THAT'S SOMETHING, TOO, THAT
