20080815171131.967|20080815171133.624|CCO|That's going to cause trouble. That's going to cause flooding, mudslides

20080815171649.226|20080815171650.874|CCO|This quickly became a really big story. Here's the basic idea: this traffic 
20080815171650.874|20080815171652.522|CCO|cop was in this area in the 
20080815171652.522|20080815171654.170|CCO|Bronx and was apparently heading off to 
20080815171654.170|20080815171655.818|CCO|lunch when a van came along and hit 
20080815171655.818|20080815171657.465|CCO|her. That left her in the middle 
20080815171657.465|20080815171659.113|CCO|of the street, too late for 
20080815171659.113|20080815171700.761|CCO|a bus to stop. 
20080815171700.761|20080815171702.409|CCO|Bus ended up on top of her. Let's 
20080815171702.409|20080815171704.057|CCO|go into the video now of the crime

20080815171713.944|20080815171715.592|CCO|Bronx and, obviously, they've had to

20080815171717.240|20080815171718.888|CCO|to study exactly what happened here.

20080815171741.958|20080815171743.605|CCO|So, what we did is the garage right

20080815171842.928|20080815171844.576|CCO|First of all, it's amazing that the baby 
20080815171844.576|20080815171846.224|CCO|survived the trauma, being hit 
20080815171846.224|20080815171847.872|CCO|by a van and then underneath

20080815171849.520|20080815171851.168|CCO|in any way. 
20080815171851.168|20080815171852.815|CCO|Second of all, what's amazing is 
20080815171852.815|20080815171854.463|CCO|that mom's heart kept beating as 
20080815171854.463|20080815171856.111|CCO|she was hit by this van, as she 
20080815171856.111|20080815171857.759|CCO|was under the bus. 
20080815171857.759|20080815171859.407|CCO|Because the baby would not be alive today

20080815171901.055|20080815171902.703|CCO|beating through all that trauma, because

20080815173846.132|20080815173847.885|CCO|that can be a common ground

20080815173914.175|20080815173915.928|CCO|are defeated through disintegration, corrosion

20080815173917.681|20080815173919.433|CCO|My first question would be, what 
20080815173919.433|20080815173921.186|CCO|are you doing to shore up the disintegrating American

20080815173938.713|20080815173940.466|CCO|peer pressure and conformity and fashion trends. 
20080815173942.219|20080815173943.971|CCO|The fact is, that religion is about two 
20080815173943.971|20080815173945.724|CCO|things. 
20080815173945.724|20080815173947.477|CCO|It's about relationships -- a relationship between God and man 
20080815173947.477|20080815173949.229|CCO|and man and his fellow man. And the 
20080815173949.229|20080815173950.982|CCO|second thing is, it's about the pursuit of 
20080815173950.982|20080815173952.735|CCO|knowledge. 
20080815173952.735|20080815173954.488|CCO|And these are the two institutions that 
20080815173954.488|20080815173956.240|CCO|are really disintegrating. We 
20080815173956.240|20080815173957.993|CCO|don't know how to have relationships 
20080815173957.993|20080815173959.746|CCO|in America today. We 
20080815173959.746|20080815174001.498|CCO|don't know how to get along and 
20080815174001.498|20080815174003.251|CCO|that's why people opt for the false idolatry of Hollywood 
20080815174003.251|20080815174005.004|CCO|and celebrity because they're not 
20080815174005.004|20080815174006.756|CCO|really giving the unconditional love

20080815174010.262|20080815174012.015|CCO|And the second thing is, our kids don't want to know. We're becoming increasingly ignorant. So, it's a translation of those faith-based

20080815174031.294|20080815174033.047|CCO|in America is that for so long it's been divisive.
