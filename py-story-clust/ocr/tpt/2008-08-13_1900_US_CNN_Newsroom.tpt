20080813190341.896|20080813190343.710|CCO|looks as if they have -- they're actually attaching

20080813190454.468|20080813190456.282|CCO|going over his shoulders. So, he's 
20080813190456.282|20080813190458.096|CCO|very much in that harness. 
20080813190458.096|20080813190459.910|CCO|And obviously the clip or whatever to 
20080813190459.910|20080813190501.725|CCO|get him out of it, they don't 
20080813190501.725|20080813190503.539|CCO|feel as if they can either, one, access, or 
20080813190503.539|20080813190505.353|CCO|that they can access it and keep him

20080813190905.535|20080813190907.641|CCO|because of the rapidity

20080813190913.958|20080813190916.064|CCO|As to the first question, if, indeed, Russia 
20080813190916.064|20080813190918.170|CCO|is violating a cease-fire -- 
20080813190918.170|20080813190920.276|CCO|and I  have to say that 
20080813190920.276|20080813190922.382|CCO|the reports are not encouraging 
20080813190922.382|20080813190924.488|CCO|about Russia's respect 
20080813190924.488|20080813190926.594|CCO|for this cease-fire, for 
20080813190926.594|20080813190928.699|CCO|the pledge that it undertook -- that 
20080813190930.805|20080813190932.911|CCO|will only serve to deepen the 
20080813190932.911|20080813190935.017|CCO|isolation into which Russia is 
20080813190935.017|20080813190937.123|CCO|moving. 
20080813190937.123|20080813190939.229|CCO|It will only serve to deepen the 
20080813190939.229|20080813190941.335|CCO|very strong, growing sense that Russia 
20080813190941.335|20080813190943.440|CCO|is not behaving like the kind 
20080813190943.440|20080813190945.546|CCO|of international partner that 
20080813190945.546|20080813190947.652|CCO|it has said that it wants to

20080813190949.758|20080813190951.864|CCO|And it's very clear to me that the 
20080813190951.864|20080813190953.970|CCO|consequences of that, which are 
20080813190953.970|20080813190956.076|CCO|already quite significant, because 
20080813190956.076|20080813190958.181|CCO|the way that Russia has brutally 
20080813190958.181|20080813191000.287|CCO|pushed this military operation 
20080813191000.287|20080813191002.393|CCO|well beyond the bounds

20080813191354.038|20080813191356.144|CCO|but that Russia seriously overreached,

20080813191423.520|20080813191425.626|CCO|these are hardly moves that are related to South Ossetia. So I  think you will see 
20080813191425.626|20080813191427.732|CCO|that the United States has been 
20080813191427.732|20080813191429.838|CCO|saying that. We were also in very, very close contact

20080813191644.613|20080813191646.718|CCO|So let's be very clear whose interests 
20080813191646.718|20080813191648.824|CCO|are being served by the 
20080813191648.824|20080813191650.930|CCO|partnership that Russia and the

20080813191659.354|20080813191701.459|CCO|And as to choosing, the United States 
20080813191701.459|20080813191703.565|CCO|has made very clear that it 
20080813191703.565|20080813191705.671|CCO|is standing by the democratically

20080813191714.095|20080813191716.201|CCO|It is a country that has made considerable

20080813191730.942|20080813191733.047|CCO|have to look at the fact that

20080813191747.788|20080813191749.894|CCO|First, the Georgian president has 
20080813191749.894|20080813191752.000|CCO|said in the afternoon that the U.S.  
20080813191752.000|20080813191754.106|CCO|forces will control the airports 
20080813191754.106|20080813191756.212|CCO|and the ports in Georgia. 
20080813191758.318|20080813191800.424|CCO|Second, do you have any reaction 
20080813191800.424|20080813191802.529|CCO|on the establishing diplomatic relations 
20080813191802.529|20080813191804.635|CCO|between Syria and Lebanon?

20080813191806.741|20080813191808.847|CCO|>> RICE: Well, on the latter, we have long 
20080813191808.847|20080813191810.953|CCO|stood for the normalization 
20080813191810.953|20080813191813.059|CCO|of relations between Syria and Lebanon 
20080813191813.059|20080813191815.165|CCO|on the basis of equality 
20080813191815.165|20080813191817.270|CCO|and respect for Lebanese sovereignty. 
20080813191819.376|20080813191821.482|CCO|One of the steps that has long been 
20080813191821.482|20080813191823.588|CCO|required is the establishment 
20080813191823.588|20080813191825.694|CCO|of a proper embassy 
20080813191825.694|20080813191827.800|CCO|for Syria in Lebanon and 
20080813191827.800|20080813191829.906|CCO|vice versa. 
20080813191829.906|20080813191832.012|CCO|Now, if the Syrians will go ahead and demarcate the 
20080813191832.012|20080813191834.117|CCO|border between Lebanon and Syria, and 
20080813191834.117|20080813191836.223|CCO|respect Syria's sovereignty 
20080813191836.223|20080813191838.329|CCO|in other ways, then this 
20080813191838.329|20080813191840.435|CCO|will have proved to be a very good step. 
20080813191842.541|20080813191844.647|CCO|As to the first question, the -- I 
20080813191844.647|20080813191846.753|CCO| think that the president was very 
20080813191846.753|20080813191848.858|CCO|clear about the nature of this 
20080813191848.858|20080813191850.964|CCO|mission. 
20080813191850.964|20080813191853.070|CCO|It is a humanitarian mission. 
20080813191853.070|20080813191855.176|CCO|We expect the air routes, the land

20080813191857.282|20080813191859.388|CCO|open for humanitarian activities. But 
20080813191901.494|20080813191903.599|CCO|I  think the Pentagon has already 
20080813191903.599|20080813191905.705|CCO|responded, noting that it 
20080813191905.705|20080813191907.811|CCO|is not the intention of the United 
20080813191907.811|20080813191909.917|CCO|States in some way to take 
20080813191909.917|20080813191912.023|CCO|control of facilities, port

20080813191920.446|20080813191922.552|CCO|of Georgian troops from Iraq, you're really involved in the

20080813191926.764|20080813191928.870|CCO|had an agreement with Georgia at the time of the Georgian deployment of its forces to Iraq that, if the Georgian government requested their return for purposes that Georgia 
20080813191928.870|20080813191930.976|CCO|deemed a priority, that we would do so, we 
20080813191930.976|20080813191933.081|CCO|would facilitate that. 
20080813191933.081|20080813191935.187|CCO|And so we carried through on our agreement. 
20080813191937.293|20080813191939.399|CCO|The point that I  made to my Russian 
20080813191939.399|20080813191941.505|CCO|counterpart and that others made is 
20080813191943.611|20080813191945.717|CCO|that, if there's a cease-fire, as 
20080813191945.717|20080813191947.823|CCO|there should be and as Russia 
20080813191947.823|20080813191949.928|CCO|has said it has stopped its military 
20080813191949.928|20080813191952.034|CCO|operations, then the return

20080813192019.410|20080813192021.516|CCO|so we all know what the Georgians 
20080813192021.516|20080813192023.622|CCO|did ultimately. So 
20080813192023.622|20080813192025.728|CCO|how did it happen? 
20080813192025.728|20080813192027.834|CCO|Did you -- by the way, did you delegate responsibility, as has been reported, to

20080813192032.046|20080813192034.151|CCO|Or, before the war, did the Georgians

20080813192059.422|20080813192101.528|CCO|The Georgians some time ago agreed

20080813192120.480|20080813192122.586|CCO|understand that this has been 
20080813192122.586|20080813192124.692|CCO|a volatile area for some time. It 
20080813192126.798|20080813192128.904|CCO|has been volatile now for more

20080813192131.010|20080813192133.116|CCO|And what we have tried to do is to 
20080813192133.116|20080813192135.221|CCO|propose and to push any number 
20080813192135.221|20080813192137.327|CCO|of peace plans -- there 
20080813192137.327|20080813192139.433|CCO|was a Georgian peace plan for South Ossetia that 
20080813192139.433|20080813192141.539|CCO|the United States tried to press. 
20080813192143.645|20080813192145.751|CCO|I  myself was there in Georgia to 
20080813192145.751|20080813192147.857|CCO|try to put together elements of a

20080813192154.174|20080813192156.280|CCO|because I  think we all recognize 
20080813192156.280|20080813192158.386|CCO|that there was volatility in this 
20080813192158.386|20080813192200.492|CCO|region, 
20080813192200.492|20080813192202.598|CCO|there was a lot of back-and-forth in

20080813192204.703|20080813192206.809|CCO|and that it was a dangerous situation. 
20080813192208.915|20080813192211.021|CCO|Now, as I  said, this is something 
20080813192211.021|20080813192213.127|CCO|that, had it been about 
20080813192213.127|20080813192215.233|CCO|South Ossetia, could have been resolved 
20080813192215.233|20080813192217.339|CCO|within certain limits. 
20080813192217.339|20080813192219.445|CCO|Russian peacekeepers were in the

20080813192221.550|20080813192223.656|CCO|That is true. 
20080813192223.656|20080813192225.762|CCO|And Russia initially said it needed 
20080813192225.762|20080813192227.868|CCO|to act to protect its peacekeepers 
20080813192227.868|20080813192229.974|CCO|and its people.

20080813192419.479|20080813192421.584|CCO|And so what Russia, I  think, is seeing
