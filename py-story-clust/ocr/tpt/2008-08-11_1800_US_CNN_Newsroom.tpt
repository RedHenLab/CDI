CORRESPONDENT: Some new details, as well as a little more on the evacuation of American citizens from the Republic of Georgia. They left, 170  of them, on a convoy -- on two convoys, actually. There's going to be another one tomorrow. They're going from Tbilisi, the capital of the Republic of Georgia, to Armenia. Over the weekend, the State Department had said that anyone who wants to go can go. And so they have arranged this and will continue to take American citizens that want to be evacuated. Now, the deputy spokesperson at the State Department, Robert Wood, also said that the U.S.  envoy that's been dispatched, Matthew Bryza, is going to be in Georgia for the next several days. He's going to be trying to get both parties to agree to a cease-fire, and also set up some sort of international mediation mechanism for the process to happen so that all sides can talk to each other. The U.S.  and Europe, he also added, are calling on Russia to accept this mediation effort and to accept an immediate cease-fire and stop Russian aggression. Another development, Brianna, is that the U.S.  has begun to provide humanitarian assistance to the Republic of Georgia. The embassy in Tbilisi has declared a disaster situation on the ground, and it's authorized about $250,000  in an initial funding. That's going to help around about 10,000

So really at the State Department this day, there is an enormous sense of urgency and a real commitment to try to get all sides to back down -- Brianna.

20080811184705.812|20080811184707.988|CCO|I  think the word carries some

20080811184731.922|20080811184734.098|CCO|about the size of Texas, and it makes so much energy out of nuclear power, it sells 
20080811184734.098|20080811184736.274|CCO|electricity to its neighbors. The U.S.,

20080811184845.902|20080811184848.078|CCO|billion. That's about four times the cost of a comparable coal plant.
