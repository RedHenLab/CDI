20080813150338.052|20080813150339.727|CCO|out here right now waiting for 
20080813150339.727|20080813150341.403|CCO|the president to come 
20080813150341.403|20080813150343.078|CCO|out to make his statement. 
20080813150343.078|20080813150344.753|CCO|As I'm sure we've already been talking about, he'll be accompanied by Defense Secretary

20080813150354.805|20080813150356.481|CCO|questions.

20080813150359.831|20080813150401.507|CCO|But as of now, the guidance is that they

20080813150403.182|20080813150404.857|CCO|questions. And you 
20080813150404.857|20080813150406.533|CCO|probably can remember that neither

20080813150408.208|20080813150409.883|CCO|in this cabinet has taken questions

20080813150414.909|20080813150416.585|CCO|So we are hoping to hear some more

20080813150418.260|20080813150419.935|CCO|And we're waiting right here in the Rose

20080813150451.587|20080813150453.251|CCO|That is what the president is expected 
20080813150453.251|20080813150454.915|CCO|to talk about, a comprehensive

20080813150504.900|20080813150506.564|CCO|It will begin with humanitarian relief

20080813150511.556|20080813150513.220|CCO|It is possible this effort will go 
20080813150513.220|20080813150514.884|CCO|on for some time as part of an effort 
20080813150514.884|20080813150516.548|CCO|to demonstrate to the Russians 
20080813150516.548|20080813150518.213|CCO|that the U.S.  can move into

20080813150526.533|20080813150528.197|CCO|on several fronts it plans to continue 
20080813150528.197|20080813150529.861|CCO|its military relationship 
20080813150529.861|20080813150531.525|CCO|with Georgia.

20080813150538.182|20080813150539.846|CCO|The U.S.  will be watching very carefully, as

20080813150541.510|20080813150543.174|CCO|see what happens on the Black

20080813150634.035|20080813150635.626|CCO|I  mean, when you look on the streets

20080813150637.218|20080813150638.809|CCO|traffic on the streets, there's

20080813150715.408|20080813150716.999|CCO|Now, I  was able to see earlier this 
20080813150716.999|20080813150718.590|CCO|morning the president of this 
20080813150718.590|20080813150720.181|CCO|nation, Mikheil Saakashvili, at a press conference. 
20080813150721.773|20080813150723.364|CCO|And there he appeared to be very defiant 
20080813150723.364|20080813150724.955|CCO|and somewhat angry, saying 
20080813150724.955|20080813150726.546|CCO|that he believes the Russians 
20080813150726.546|20080813150728.138|CCO|had violated the terms of 
20080813150728.138|20080813150729.729|CCO|that cease-fire agreement that 
20080813150729.729|20080813150731.320|CCO|is supposed to be in place between 
20080813150731.320|20080813150732.911|CCO|these two nations. 
20080813150732.911|20080813150734.503|CCO|And that, of course, calls for both 
20080813150734.503|20080813150736.094|CCO|sides to end hostilities and 
20080813150736.094|20080813150737.685|CCO|also for both sides not to advance 
20080813150737.685|20080813150739.276|CCO|across their positions. 
20080813150739.276|20080813150740.868|CCO|Now, the Russians, of course, for their part, are 
20080813150740.868|20080813150742.459|CCO|saying they don't believe that 
20080813150742.459|20080813150744.050|CCO|they violated the terms of that cease-fire 
20080813150744.050|20080813150745.641|CCO|agreement. 
20080813150745.641|20080813150747.233|CCO|They say they were only using that tank 
20080813150747.233|20080813150748.824|CCO|column to go to a military base 
20080813150748.824|20080813150750.415|CCO|and to demilitarize a zone here

20080813150752.006|20080813150753.598|CCO|But of course, that's something that's by far 
20080813150753.598|20080813150755.189|CCO|not good enough and not satisfactory 
20080813150755.189|20080813150756.780|CCO|to the Georgian government. 
20080813150758.371|20080813150759.963|CCO|They say they believe Russia's ultimate

20080813150812.693|20080813150814.284|CCO|least softened his public rhetoric? 
20080813150815.875|20080813150817.466|CCO|He seems to have very few cards to

20080813150823.831|20080813150825.423|CCO|And that is certainly something that 
20080813150825.423|20080813150827.014|CCO|some of the people that we've been talking

20080813150831.788|20080813150833.379|CCO|They say he didn't always play his

20080813150834.970|20080813150836.561|CCO|They say he might have miscalculated

20080813150844.518|20080813150846.109|CCO|he hasn't softened up his rhetoric 
20080813150846.109|20080813150847.700|CCO|whatsoever. He's still hurling 
20080813150847.700|20080813150849.291|CCO|accusations at the Russian 
20080813150849.291|20080813150850.883|CCO|government. 
20080813150850.883|20080813150852.474|CCO|He is saying that the Russians are 
20080813150852.474|20080813150854.065|CCO|committing atrocities in cities 
20080813150854.065|20080813150855.656|CCO|like Gori. He's accusing them of

20080813150858.839|20080813150900.430|CCO|So, very, very strong words coming from

20080813150902.021|20080813150903.613|CCO|And he's also saying that his country

20080813150905.204|20080813150906.795|CCO|to enter the city, that the

20080813151230.912|20080813151232.713|CCO|And in the days ahead, we will use 
20080813151232.713|20080813151234.513|CCO|U.S.  aircraft, as well as naval 
20080813151234.513|20080813151236.313|CCO|forces, to deliver humanitarian

20080813151239.913|20080813151241.713|CCO|We expect Russia to honor its commitment 
20080813151241.713|20080813151243.514|CCO|to let in all forms of

20080813151248.914|20080813151250.714|CCO|including seaports, airports,

20080813151257.915|20080813151259.715|CCO|We expect Russia to meet its commitment 
20080813151259.715|20080813151301.515|CCO|to cease all military 
20080813151301.515|20080813151303.316|CCO|activities in Georgia, and we expect 
20080813151303.316|20080813151305.116|CCO|all Russian forces that entered

20080813151306.916|20080813151308.716|CCO|to withdraw from that country. 
20080813151310.516|20080813151312.316|CCO|So I  have made clear Russia's ongoing 
20080813151312.316|20080813151314.117|CCO|action raises serious questions 
20080813151314.117|20080813151315.917|CCO|about its intentions in 
20080813151315.917|20080813151317.717|CCO|Georgia and the region. 
20080813151317.717|20080813151319.517|CCO|In recent years, Russia has sought to 
20080813151319.517|20080813151321.317|CCO|integrate into the diplomatic,

20080813151355.521|20080813151357.321|CCO|statement from President Bush there

20080813151406.322|20080813151408.122|CCO|Want to get back over to Zain Verjee now 
20080813151408.122|20080813151409.922|CCO|in the State Department to 
20080813151409.922|20080813151411.722|CCO|talk a little bit more about what 
20080813151411.722|20080813151413.523|CCO|we have heard here, which again, I  
20080813151413.523|20080813151415.323|CCO|would say, as we listened 
20080813151415.323|20080813151417.123|CCO|to that, some strong words. 
20080813151418.923|20080813151420.723|CCO|Obviously, you see some of them on 
20080813151420.723|20080813151422.523|CCO|the bottom of the screen there: "Russia 
20080813151422.523|20080813151424.324|CCO|must keep its word and act 
20080813151424.324|20080813151426.124|CCO|to end this crisis." A  couple 
20080813151426.124|20080813151427.924|CCO|of other things. Said that some of these 
20080813151427.924|20080813151429.724|CCO|actions were very inconsistent to the

20080813151440.525|20080813151442.325|CCO|So, once again, want to get over to Zain Verjee now. Zain, when 
20080813151442.325|20080813151444.126|CCO|you listened to that, 
20080813151444.126|20080813151445.926|CCO|what did you hear him talking about? Particularly 
20080813151445.926|20080813151447.726|CCO|interested in this Gori 
20080813151447.726|20080813151449.526|CCO|Highway. 
20080813151449.526|20080813151451.326|CCO|He seemed to be particularly concerned 
20080813151451.326|20080813151453.126|CCO|about the blockage of it. 
20080813151454.927|20080813151614.135|NER_01|Person=Zain Verjee|Role=CNN STATE DEPARTMENT CORRESPONDENT
20080813151454.927|20080813151456.727|CCO|>> VERJEE: Exactly, 
20080813151456.727|20080813151458.527|CCO|because that highway really is the 
20080813151458.527|20080813151500.327|CCO|strategic highway into the main 
20080813151500.327|20080813151502.127|CCO|capital city, Tbilisi. And Russia's 
20080813151502.127|20080813151503.928|CCO|control of that is going 
20080813151503.928|20080813151505.728|CCO|to be detrimental, possibly 
20080813151505.728|20080813151507.528|CCO|for humanitarian reasons, as well 
20080813151507.528|20080813151509.328|CCO|as the U.S.  has been calling for 
20080813151509.328|20080813151511.128|CCO|Russia to leave. So its very presence 
20080813151511.128|20080813151512.928|CCO|on the ground poses a problem 
20080813151512.928|20080813151514.729|CCO|for diplomacy. 
20080813151514.729|20080813151516.529|CCO|The other thing that struck me in 
20080813151516.529|20080813151518.329|CCO|that conversation is that the 
20080813151518.329|20080813151520.129|CCO|United States is turning up the diplomatic 
20080813151520.129|20080813151521.929|CCO|pressure. 
20080813151521.929|20080813151523.730|CCO|President Bush announcing that Secretary

20080813151532.730|20080813151534.531|CCO|with the French president, Sarkozy, who 
20080813151534.531|20080813151536.331|CCO|has really been taking the 
20080813151536.331|20080813151538.131|CCO|lead thus far on diplomatic 
20080813151538.131|20080813151539.931|CCO|efforts to try and push

20080813151541.731|20080813151543.532|CCO|want.

20080813151545.332|20080813151547.132|CCO|to Tbilisi, in Georgia, and 
20080813151547.132|20080813151548.932|CCO|have face-to-face discussions 
20080813151548.932|20080813151550.732|CCO|with President Sarkozy. 
20080813151552.532|20080813151554.333|CCO|He insisted, too, that the United 
20080813151554.333|20080813151556.133|CCO|States will give its unwavering 
20080813151556.133|20080813151557.933|CCO|support to Georgia, and 
20080813151557.933|20080813151559.733|CCO|that it stands for its territorial

20080813151603.333|20080813151605.134|CCO|And Secretary of State Rice is going

20080813151639.337|20080813151641.137|CCO|>> STARR: Well, Tony, all of that pretty 
20080813151641.137|20080813151642.937|CCO|well laid out. 
20080813151642.937|20080813151644.738|CCO|But I  think what struck me first 
20080813151644.738|20080813151646.538|CCO|is, once again, President Bush embarked 
20080813151646.538|20080813151648.338|CCO|on a very interesting strategy 
20080813151648.338|20080813151650.138|CCO|here, exactly what he did 
20080813151650.138|20080813151651.938|CCO|the other day at the White House, 
20080813151651.938|20080813151653.738|CCO|basically laying out the intelligence case, 
20080813151653.738|20080813151655.539|CCO|the intelligence information 
20080813151655.539|20080813151657.339|CCO|that the U.S.  
20080813151657.339|20080813151659.139|CCO|believes it has it about what Russia 
20080813151659.139|20080813151700.939|CCO|is up to. 
20080813151700.939|20080813151702.739|CCO|Really a directed message at the 
20080813151702.739|20080813151704.540|CCO|Russian government, being very specific 
20080813151704.540|20080813151706.340|CCO|about these reports, about 
20080813151706.340|20080813151708.140|CCO|the Russians being on that 
20080813151708.140|20080813151709.940|CCO|key highway outside of Gori, about 
20080813151709.940|20080813151711.740|CCO|blocking Georgian ports, about blowing 
20080813151711.740|20080813151713.540|CCO|up Georgian vessels. 
20080813151713.540|20080813151715.341|CCO|These are matters of very closely-held intelligence

20080813151717.141|20080813151718.941|CCO|that the U.S.  has been trying 
20080813151718.941|20080813151720.741|CCO|to verify. And the president, 
20080813151720.741|20080813151722.541|CCO|just like he did the other 
20080813151722.541|20080813151724.342|CCO|day, laying it all out there, basically 
20080813151724.342|20080813151726.142|CCO|saying right to Moscow, we know 
20080813151726.142|20080813151727.942|CCO|what you're doing and stop it. 
20080813151729.742|20080813151731.542|CCO|Whether he is successful remains 
20080813151731.542|20080813151733.342|CCO|to be seen. 
20080813151733.342|20080813151735.143|CCO|He is also choosing his words very

20080813151749.544|20080813151751.344|CCO|is numerous ongoing C-17

20080813151753.144|20080813151754.945|CCO|And once you start talking about 
20080813151754.945|20080813151756.745|CCO|that, you are talking about the possibility 
20080813151756.745|20080813151758.545|CCO|of putting some contingent 
20080813151758.545|20080813151800.345|CCO|on the ground at the airport

20080813151812.946|20080813151814.747|CCO|There is a possibility that we are

20080813152026.160|20080813152027.960|CCO|pointed it out, but the fact 
20080813152027.960|20080813152029.760|CCO|that President Bush took the

20080813152036.961|20080813152038.761|CCO|to the Russian leadership that 
20080813152038.761|20080813152040.561|CCO|the administration is

20080813152044.161|20080813152045.962|CCO|And he had a very pointed statement: Russia's 
20080813152045.962|20080813152047.762|CCO|actions have raised 
20080813152047.762|20080813152049.562|CCO|serious questions about their

20080813152056.763|20080813152058.563|CCO|So I  think you picked out a very

20080813152100.363|20080813152102.163|CCO|go overlooked, is that the president

20080813152421.747|20080813152423.278|CCO|map we have, which is our one up at CNN.com right now. I 
20080813152423.278|20080813152424.809|CCO| want to talk you all through the basics 
20080813152424.809|20080813152426.340|CCO|of what we're seeing today. 
20080813152427.871|20080813152429.402|CCO|Here's Russia, here's Georgia. 
20080813152429.402|20080813152430.932|CCO|This is South Ossetia. 
20080813152430.932|20080813152432.463|CCO|And yes, I'm pronouncing it that way. We can talk about that later. South Ossetia right here. Now, what we heard today, early this 
20080813152432.463|20080813152433.994|CCO|morning, the reason everyone 
20080813152433.994|20080813152435.525|CCO|was buzzing, was that Russian 
20080813152435.525|20080813152437.056|CCO|troops were here in Gori 
20080813152437.056|20080813152438.587|CCO|and apparently traveling eastward. 
20080813152438.587|20080813152440.118|CCO|And there were concerns by the Georgians that they might 
20080813152440.118|20080813152441.649|CCO|be headed toward Tbilisi, the 
20080813152441.649|20080813152443.180|CCO|capital. 
20080813152443.180|20080813152444.710|CCO|Well, here is what Russia is saying. 
20080813152444.710|20080813152446.241|CCO|As part of resolving this whole conflict, 
20080813152446.241|20080813152447.772|CCO|Russia wants no Georgian troops 
20080813152447.772|20080813152449.303|CCO|at all back in South Ossetia. None. But they also want 
20080813152449.303|20080813152450.834|CCO|to create what they're calling a demilitarized zone. 
20080813152452.365|20080813152453.896|CCO|Let's actually zoom back in here. 
20080813152453.896|20080813152455.427|CCO|I  want to show you, they want a demilitarized zone all 
20080813152455.427|20080813152456.957|CCO|along the outside of South Ossetia 
20080813152456.957|20080813152458.488|CCO|right there. 
20080813152458.488|20080813152500.019|CCO|So Russia is saying today they've 
20080813152500.019|20080813152501.550|CCO|been going around basically 
20080813152501.550|20080813152503.081|CCO|getting rid of Georgian

20080813152515.328|20080813152516.859|CCO|made mention of it specifically, of this East-West

20080813152518.390|20080813152519.921|CCO|know, the fact that Russia is

20080813152522.982|20080813152524.513|CCO|And that has really broad implications

All right next one now. Colleen: "The real singer is absolutely adorable. The organizers should consider what kind of impact this has on children all over. A  real shame." 
20080813154926.492|20080813154928.362|CCO|Now here comes the debate.

20080813155003.881|20080813155005.751|CCO|Let's do a couple more here. "Imagine
