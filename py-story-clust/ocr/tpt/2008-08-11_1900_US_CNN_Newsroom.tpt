20080811190529.275|20080811190531.254|CCO|And this is according to this referenda that 
20080811190531.254|20080811190533.232|CCO|has not been officially

20080811190535.211|20080811190537.190|CCO|at least a good chunk of people 
20080811190537.190|20080811190539.169|CCO|in those two enclaves who 
20080811190539.169|20080811190541.148|CCO|would like independence from the 
20080811190541.148|20080811190543.127|CCO|Republic of Georgia. 
20080811190543.127|20080811190545.106|CCO|This is a result of the disintegration 
20080811190545.106|20080811190547.085|CCO|of the Soviet Union 
20080811190547.085|20080811190549.064|CCO|in the early '90s and all these

20080811190551.042|20080811190553.021|CCO|others that have splintered 
20080811190553.021|20080811190555.000|CCO|off from the Soviet Union. 
20080811190556.979|20080811190558.958|CCO|This is essentially a settling of the 
20080811190558.958|20080811190600.937|CCO|borders post-Cold War. 
20080811190600.937|20080811190602.916|CCO|These two enclaves want independence from Georgia. Or at least the very least, a sizable chunk of people in these two enclaves want independence. 
20080811190604.895|20080811190606.874|CCO|Russia for its part says that South Ossetia has most of its citizens, most

20080811190608.853|20080811190610.831|CCO|so therefore says it has a

Three people were killed early yesterday when their casino bus turned over south of Memphis. It was headed to Harrah's Tunica. Now, more than 30  survivors are flying home to South Carolina today, no word on what caused that crash. Tire failure may be to blame for another bus accident, this one in Las Vegas. Almost 30  casino employees were hurt, four critically, when their shuttle bus crashed last night. Investigators say they found evidence the tread had separated from the left front tire. Something similar may have happened in Sherman, Texas. Investigators say it appears a recapped tire may have blown, causing the crash that killed 17  passengers on Friday. Federal investigators say the charter company operating that bus was unlicensed. It and a related company have been ordered to stop operating immediately. A  Michigan teen says her life will never be the same after she got a shot to prevent a deadly disease. We will tell you why she is blaming the vaccine Gardasil. A  dangerous turn in a mission of peace. American missionaries hunker down as Russian tanks roll into the Republic of Georgia. We have got this harrowing story for you and some new video that is just coming in. And a former American Olympic star heads to Beijing to be with friends. Our Fredricka Whitfield, it is her dead.

20080811191736.727|20080811191738.605|CCO|to evacuate them. 
20080811191738.605|20080811191740.482|CCO|The United States is playing some

20080811191742.359|20080811191744.236|CCO|It's evacuating Georgian troops from

20080811193153.290|20080811193155.028|CCO|outside of Abkhazia. That is one of the enclaves

20080811193156.765|20080811193158.503|CCO|people there want independence

20080811193205.454|20080811193207.192|CCO|There is fighting going on in that

20080811193210.667|20080811193212.405|CCO|We were mentioning earlier, South Ossetia. Now there are fears that the capital 
20080811193212.405|20080811193214.143|CCO|of Tbilisi -- or there were 
20080811193214.143|20080811193215.881|CCO|fears, to be more precise, that the 
20080811193215.881|20080811193217.618|CCO|capital of Tbilisi was under

20080811193228.045|20080811193229.783|CCO|enclaves where there are desires for independence

20080811193234.996|20080811193236.734|CCO|that is because the 
20080811193236.734|20080811193238.471|CCO|French foreign minister and the French 
20080811193238.471|20080811193240.209|CCO|president and other international leaders are saying look, back

20080811193245.422|20080811193247.160|CCO|Now, as to why the United States cares, 
20080811193247.160|20080811193248.898|CCO|why George Bush, among others, is 
20080811193248.898|20080811193250.636|CCO|siding with Georgia on 
20080811193250.636|20080811193252.373|CCO|this, well, we have video from all the 
20080811193252.373|20080811193254.111|CCO|way back in 2005,  when the president

20080811193255.849|20080811193257.587|CCO|there. Now, I'll remind our viewers this. You know, Georgia 
20080811193257.587|20080811193259.324|CCO|has the third largest contingent 
20080811193259.324|20080811193301.062|CCO|of troops in Iraq. 
20080811193301.062|20080811193302.800|CCO|Georgia wants to be part of NATO.  
20080811193302.800|20080811193304.538|CCO|Georgia 
20080811193304.538|20080811193306.275|CCO|wants to be close to the 
20080811193306.275|20080811193308.013|CCO|West under Mikheil Saakashvili. 
20080811193308.013|20080811193309.751|CCO|It was different before 2003.  But over 
20080811193309.751|20080811193311.488|CCO|the last five years, that has 
20080811193311.488|20080811193313.226|CCO|been the case. 
20080811193313.226|20080811193314.964|CCO|And you can see there "Welcome in Georgia." That was a sign held 
20080811193314.964|20080811193316.702|CCO|up by a Georgian about three years 
20080811193316.702|20080811193318.439|CCO|ago. 
20080811193318.439|20080811193320.177|CCO|It's not everywhere in the world you

20080811193321.915|20080811193323.653|CCO|So that explains strategically why the

20080811194500.459|20080811194502.490|CCO|And it's what you were just talking about before the break. We said, "Should this matter -- should

20080811194508.584|20080811194510.615|CCO|Here are some of our really interesting e-mails. First, from Arwood Haile -- you see it here, Haile: "In 
20080811194510.615|20080811194512.646|CCO|48  years of marriage, I've

20080811194520.771|20080811194522.802|CCO|in leading such a great country?" Now, let's look at the other side. From Louis Bryan: "No. No. A  
20080811194522.802|20080811194524.834|CCO|thousand 
20080811194524.834|20080811194526.865|CCO|times no.

20080811194534.990|20080811194537.021|CCO|Elizabeth Edwards is coping with incurable cancer. She has asked politely for the media to back off." Let's keep going. Stu McCullouch here: "As a contributor to the John Edwards 
20080811194537.021|20080811194539.052|CCO|campaign, I'm very disappointed 
20080811194539.052|20080811194541.084|CCO|in such a late confession 
20080811194541.084|20080811194543.115|CCO|and feel very badly about the 
20080811194543.115|20080811194545.146|CCO|followers who donated their

20080811194547.177|20080811194549.209|CCO|It isn't the deed, it's the lie." 
20080811194549.209|20080811194551.240|CCO|Now, Terry Decker: "Do judgment, character, integrity, 
20080811194551.240|20080811194553.271|CCO|loyalty, faithfulness, 
20080811194553.271|20080811194555.302|CCO|honesty, compassion, 
20080811194555.302|20080811194557.334|CCO|etc. mean nothing? Of course we should know whether our leaders have those qualities." And now there's another one here from Jolene -- Jolene Pope: "It's 
20080811194559.365|20080811194601.396|CCO|none of the public's business. 
20080811194603.427|20080811194605.459|CCO|If a married politician has an affair, the only way it becomes the public's 
20080811194605.459|20080811194607.490|CCO|business is if there is

20080811194611.552|20080811194613.584|CCO|So there you go. That's the balance.
