20080815150949.153|20080815150951.324|CCO|you that for most of the European 
20080815150951.324|20080815150953.496|CCO|countries, with some 
20080815150953.496|20080815150955.668|CCO|noticeable

20080815150953.496|20080815150955.668|CCO|remarkable exceptions, there was pretty 
20080815150955.668|20080815150957.839|CCO|muted and quiet reaction to 
20080815150957.839|20080815151000.011|CCO|all this. 
20080815151000.011|20080815151002.183|CCO|And Russians were carefully watching 
20080815151002.183|20080815151004.355|CCO|this reaction. 
20080815151004.355|20080815151006.526|CCO|They were doing step by step. 
20080815151006.526|20080815151008.698|CCO|First some infrastructure, then some additional 
20080815151008.698|20080815151010.870|CCO|troops. Then little acts, 
20080815151010.870|20080815151013.041|CCO|then again infrastructure, again 
20080815151013.041|20080815151015.213|CCO|some intrusion. And watching 
20080815151015.213|20080815151017.385|CCO|carefully what Europeans 
20080815151017.385|20080815151019.556|CCO|have to say, watching carefully, 
20080815151019.556|20080815151021.728|CCO|what would be the counter-reaction of 
20080815151021.728|20080815151023.900|CCO|the international community? And it really did not follow. And Madame Secretary, 
20080815151026.072|20080815151028.243|CCO|as we were standing here last time, 
20080815151028.243|20080815151030.415|CCO|a few weeks ago, there was 
20080815151030.415|20080815151032.587|CCO|an intrusion of Russian planes 
20080815151032.587|20080815151034.758|CCO|into Georgian airspace. Just exactly in 
20080815151034.758|20080815151036.930|CCO|the lines of self-position (ph). And you 
20080815151039.102|20080815151041.273|CCO|remember as well as I  do that we 
20080815151041.273|20080815151043.445|CCO|don't believe it. I  
20080815151043.445|20080815151045.617|CCO|don't believe it myself. 
20080815151045.617|20080815151047.789|CCO|I  said, well, they are here just to solute Secretary 
20080815151047.789|20080815151049.960|CCO|Rice. 
20080815151049.960|20080815151052.132|CCO|And normally in the past, Russians 
20080815151052.132|20080815151054.304|CCO|would deny that. But 
20080815151054.304|20080815151056.475|CCO|this time they said, yes, this is 
20080815151056.475|20080815151058.647|CCO|us. 
20080815151058.647|20080815151100.819|CCO|We flew there, implying that there was 
20080815151100.819|20080815151102.991|CCO|an intent to bob against Georgians. 
20080815151105.162|20080815151107.334|CCO|And again, they watched the European 
20080815151107.334|20080815151109.506|CCO|reactions. No 
20080815151109.506|20080815151111.677|CCO|European country said anything 
20080815151111.677|20080815151113.849|CCO|about this. So 
20080815151113.849|20080815151116.021|CCO|who invited the trouble here? 
20080815151116.021|20080815151118.192|CCO|Who invited this arrogance here? 
20080815151118.192|20080815151120.364|CCO|Who invited these innocent deaths here? 
20080815151122.536|20080815151124.708|CCO|Who is -- not only those people who perpetrate them are responsible, but also those people who failed to stop it. And 
20080815151124.708|20080815151126.879|CCO|who is trying now to look 
20080815151126.879|20080815151129.051|CCO|for every excuse, saying, oh, you 
20080815151129.051|20080815151131.223|CCO|know, Georgians might have started 
20080815151131.223|20080815151133.394|CCO|it? 
20080815151133.394|20080815151135.566|CCO|Excuse me. 
20080815151135.566|20080815151137.738|CCO|Twelve hundred tanks came into Georgia within a few hours. 
20080815151137.738|20080815151139.909|CCO|There 
20080815151139.909|20080815151142.081|CCO|is no way you can mobilize

20080815151144.253|20080815151146.425|CCO|you were ready. 
20080815151146.425|20080815151148.596|CCO|There were Russian pensioners

20080815151155.111|20080815151157.283|CCO|There was no way they were not preparing

20080815151159.455|20080815151201.626|CCO|Why would they call back the pensioners (ph)? 
20080815151201.626|20080815151203.798|CCO|There were all those moments on the 
20080815151203.798|20080815151205.970|CCO|ground all around the place. 
20080815151205.970|20080815151208.142|CCO|You know when this all started, 
20080815151208.142|20080815151210.313|CCO|I  want the world to know I  was gone 
20080815151210.313|20080815151212.485|CCO|for a holiday. 
20080815151212.485|20080815151214.657|CCO|My defense minister was gone for 
20080815151214.657|20080815151216.828|CCO|a holiday. 
20080815151216.828|20080815151219.000|CCO|When the thing started, I  had to 
20080815151219.000|20080815151221.172|CCO|rush back, cut my holiday short, 
20080815151221.172|20080815151223.343|CCO|when the tensions started to raise. 
20080815151225.515|20080815151227.687|CCO|I  had to summon back our defense 
20080815151227.687|20080815151229.859|CCO|minister. 
20080815151229.859|20080815151232.030|CCO|But most of our officials were gone. 
20080815151232.030|20080815151234.202|CCO|Most of the decision-makers I  
20080815151234.202|20080815151236.374|CCO|tried to reach were gone for vacations. It 
20080815151238.545|20080815151240.717|CCO|was brilliantly selected timing 
20080815151240.717|20080815151242.889|CCO|for this intervention. 
20080815151242.889|20080815151245.061|CCO|And unfortunately, today we are looking evil directly in

20080815151249.404|20080815151251.576|CCO|And today this evil is very strong,

20080815151253.747|20080815151255.919|CCO|for everybody,

20080815151258.091|20080815151300.262|CCO|That is what we learned. But 
20080815151300.262|20080815151302.434|CCO|together, this could be and will 
20080815151302.434|20080815151304.606|CCO|be only the first chapter. 
20080815151304.606|20080815151306.778|CCO|Let us write the next chapters together

20080815151313.293|20080815151315.464|CCO|We will rebuild.

20080815151335.010|20080815151337.181|CCO|Those tanks that were taken out of

20080815151343.696|20080815151345.868|CCO|Georgia was the first one to take 
20080815151345.868|20080815151348.040|CCO|their hit, but they are on the roll. 
20080815151350.212|20080815151352.383|CCO|They are euphoric.

20080815151356.727|20080815151358.898|CCO|But I  can tell you, never, ever my 
20080815151358.898|20080815151401.070|CCO|small nation of Georgia, that has 
20080815151401.070|20080815151403.242|CCO|already gone for 70  years of subjugation by

20080815151405.413|20080815151407.585|CCO|exactly the similar circumstances. In 1921,  
20080815151407.585|20080815151409.757|CCO|Russia claimed Georgia 
20080815151409.757|20080815151411.929|CCO|attacked one of its minorities, entered Georgia

20080815151420.615|20080815151422.787|CCO|slavery and humiliation. I 
20080815151422.787|20080815151424.959|CCO| grew up with the idea that this 
20080815151424.959|20080815151427.130|CCO|should never happen again. 
20080815151427.130|20080815151429.302|CCO|I  wept when Berlin Wall came down. I  
20080815151429.302|20080815151431.474|CCO|thought 
20080815151431.474|20080815151433.646|CCO|that people like former KGB

20080815151435.817|20080815151437.989|CCO|Well, on that one I  was wrong. But on one I  
20080815151437.989|20080815151440.161|CCO|was never wrong, and I  will never be wrong. And I  
20080815151440.161|20080815151442.332|CCO|will be very strong on that one, together 
20080815151442.332|20080815151444.504|CCO|with my people. You saw 
20080815151444.504|20080815151446.676|CCO|a huge rally in downtown Tbilisi two days ago. Never, 
20080815151448.848|20080815151451.019|CCO|ever Georgia will succumb

20080815151453.191|20080815151455.363|CCO|Never, ever we will surrender. 
20080815151455.363|20080815151457.534|CCO|Never, ever we will give our freedom

20080815151501.878|20080815151504.049|CCO|freedom will go to every part

20080815151510.565|20080815151512.736|CCO|And we will definitely get rid of these

20080815151514.908|20080815151517.080|CCO|I'm totally convinced on that one.

20080815151604.857|20080815151607.029|CCO|I  have to specify, today there is new 
20080815151607.029|20080815151609.200|CCO|report by Human Rights Watch saying that Russia 
20080815151609.200|20080815151611.372|CCO|used cluster bombs against civilians, killing 
20080815151611.372|20080815151613.544|CCO|lots of local civilians, as well as a journalist. This 
20080815151613.544|20080815151615.716|CCO|is an inhuman weapon. 
20080815151615.716|20080815151617.887|CCO|Two days ago, they used weapons of 
20080815151617.887|20080815151620.059|CCO|massive destruction. 
20080815151620.059|20080815151622.231|CCO|We saw SS-21.  This is an upgraded version of SS-20

20080815151626.574|20080815151628.746|CCO|They are now using them again against their neighboring countries. They've used it against pipelines

20080815151633.089|20080815151635.261|CCO|They -- there continues instances of massive looting and ethnic

20080815151639.604|20080815151641.776|CCO|machines rolling, today, already. 
20080815151641.776|20080815151643.948|CCO|And I  accuse those 
20080815151643.948|20080815151646.119|CCO|people who write these articles in 
20080815151646.119|20080815151648.291|CCO|some newspapers, some of them 
20080815151648.291|20080815151650.463|CCO|might be genuine, but there are 
20080815151650.463|20080815151652.635|CCO|lots of people on Russian payroll 
20080815151652.635|20080815151654.806|CCO|willing to say just anything and 
20080815151654.806|20080815151656.978|CCO|justify just anything Russia is 
20080815151656.978|20080815151659.150|CCO|doing. 
20080815151659.150|20080815151701.321|CCO|There were such people before Second 
20080815151701.321|20080815151703.493|CCO|World War. There were people who would 
20080815151703.493|20080815151705.665|CCO|justify anything Stalin did in terms of gulag. There 
20080815151707.836|20080815151710.008|CCO|were people willing to justify 
20080815151710.008|20080815151712.180|CCO|anything Hitler would do in Europe. There 
20080815151712.180|20080815151714.352|CCO|are still such people. 
20080815151714.352|20080815151716.523|CCO|But I  think predominantly, international 
20080815151716.523|20080815151718.695|CCO|opinion is absolutely 
20080815151718.695|20080815151720.867|CCO|clear. 
20080815151720.867|20080815151723.038|CCO|It's 
20080815151720.867|20080815151723.038|CCO|(INAUDIBLE)
20080815151720.867|20080815151723.038|CCO|hesitations about what's really 
20080815151723.038|20080815151725.210|CCO|going on. 
20080815151725.210|20080815151727.382|CCO|It's an unprovoked, brutal invasion 
20080815151727.382|20080815151729.553|CCO|and attack to kill Georgian democracy 
20080815151729.553|20080815151731.725|CCO|and to end

20080815151733.897|20080815151736.069|CCO|And we together will deter it. 
20080815151736.069|20080815151738.240|CCO|And I  think the last thing I  want to 
20080815151738.240|20080815151740.412|CCO|say, Madame Secretary, we have a good 
20080815151740.412|20080815151742.584|CCO|agreement on rebuilding Georgia 
20080815151742.584|20080815151744.755|CCO|infrastructure, economy.

20080815151755.614|20080815151757.786|CCO|I  want my country to shine and go

20080815151802.129|20080815151804.301|CCO|I  want to know -- I  know that there 
20080815151804.301|20080815151806.472|CCO|are other things, but I  
20080815151806.472|20080815151808.644|CCO|want you to know this is not some 
20080815151808.644|20080815151810.816|CCO|shattered country, failed state. 
20080815151812.988|20080815151815.159|CCO|It was a failed state a few years ago, 
20080815151815.159|20080815151817.331|CCO|and Russia was perfectly comfortable

20080815152201.016|20080815152203.188|CCO|fast. And eventually we need

20080815152801.519|20080815152803.690|CCO|it was never only about those territories. It

20080815153011.821|20080815153013.993|CCO|been prevented. We were screaming,

20080815153016.164|20080815153018.336|CCO|that Russia was going to do this. 
20080815153020.508|20080815153022.679|CCO|I  told to a number of European leaders

20080815153027.023|20080815153029.194|CCO|And they usually told me that I  
20080815153029.194|20080815153031.366|CCO|was overplaying the threat, overestimating

20080815153127.830|20080815153130.002|CCO|And finally, we got where we got, when 
20080815153130.002|20080815153132.174|CCO|there were no lines left and there was only

20080815153134.346|20080815153136.517|CCO|So what I'm saying -- I'm worried 
20080815153136.517|20080815153138.689|CCO|about now is that unless

20080815153524.546|20080815153526.718|CCO|will be with its allies, of

20080815153531.061|20080815153533.233|CCO|I'm certain that there will be a 
20080815153533.233|20080815153535.404|CCO|confirmation of NATO's Trans-Atlantic vision 
20080815153535.404|20080815153537.576|CCO|for Georgia, as 
20080815153537.576|20080815153539.748|CCO|well as for Ukraine, of NATO's

20080815153550.606|20080815153552.778|CCO|discussion of, as I  said, the consequences 
20080815153552.778|20080815153554.950|CCO|of what Russia has done. 
20080815153557.121|20080815153559.293|CCO|President Bush put it best when he 
20080815153559.293|20080815153601.465|CCO|said that the Russians have sought integration 
20080815153601.465|20080815153603.637|CCO|into political, 
20080815153603.637|20080815153605.808|CCO|diplomatic, economic fora (ph), 
20080815153605.808|20080815153607.980|CCO|and that this calls into question 
20080815153607.980|20080815153610.152|CCO|what role Russia really 
20080815153610.152|20080815153612.323|CCO|intends to play in international 
20080815153612.323|20080815153614.495|CCO|politics. 
20080815153614.495|20080815153616.667|CCO|Because one thing is certain, you 
20080815153616.667|20080815153618.839|CCO|can't on the one hand participate 
20080815153618.839|20080815153621.010|CCO|in, and be a responsible

20080815153634.040|20080815153636.212|CCO|So that's a discussion that's going

20080815153638.384|20080815153640.556|CCO|But the president and I  have spent most

20080815153704.444|20080815153706.616|CCO|and certainly, even as the Georgian 
20080815153706.616|20080815153708.788|CCO|president admitted himself, a 
20080815153708.788|20080815153710.960|CCO|very, very passionate one. 
20080815153710.960|20080815153712.717|CCO|I  want to get to Elaine Quijano, our White House correspondent, to 
20080815153712.717|20080815153714.475|CCO|talk a little bit more about this. 
20080815153714.475|20080815153716.233|CCO|So Elaine, the Georgian president has 
20080815153716.233|20080815153717.990|CCO|now signed this six-point agreement, but it 
20080815153717.990|20080815153719.748|CCO|required clarification from Secretary 
20080815153719.748|20080815153721.506|CCO|of State Rice.

20080815153719.748|20080815153721.506|CCO|>> ELAINE QUIJANO, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: That's 
20080815153721.506|20080815153723.264|CCO|exactly right. 
20080815153725.021|20080815153726.779|CCO|And that is the key point, Heidi. You're exactly right. 
20080815153726.779|20080815153728.537|CCO|That was a big question, whether 
20080815153728.537|20080815153730.295|CCO|or not this loophole that existed 
20080815153730.295|20080815153732.052|CCO|in the original agreement 
20080815153732.052|20080815153733.810|CCO|that was hammered out, along 
20080815153733.810|20080815153735.568|CCO|with French president Nicolas 
20080815153735.568|20080815153737.325|CCO|Sarkozy, was going to be closed. 
20080815153739.083|20080815153740.841|CCO|That loophole basically amounted 
20080815153740.841|20080815153742.599|CCO|to one phrase that would have allowed 
20080815153742.599|20080815153744.356|CCO|Russia to -- quote, unquote -- "implement additional 
20080815153744.356|20080815153746.114|CCO|security measures until 
20080815153746.114|20080815153747.872|CCO|international security could 
20080815153747.872|20080815153749.630|CCO|be implemented." Now, 
20080815153749.630|20080815153751.387|CCO|the thinking was that perhaps 
20080815153751.387|20080815153753.145|CCO|Russia might interpret that 
20080815153753.145|20080815153754.903|CCO|particular phrase, "additional 
20080815153754.903|20080815153756.660|CCO|security measures," as 
20080815153756.660|20080815153758.418|CCO|a green light to go ahead and 
20080815153758.418|20080815153800.176|CCO|continue a military occupation deep

20080815153803.691|20080815153805.449|CCO|South Ossetia. 
20080815153805.449|20080815153807.207|CCO|Now we are hearing from Secretary 
20080815153807.207|20080815153808.965|CCO|of State Condoleezza Rice 
20080815153808.965|20080815153810.722|CCO|that that key point has now 
20080815153810.722|20080815153812.480|CCO|been addressed. 
20080815153812.480|20080815153814.238|CCO|She says that with this agreement, all 
20080815153814.238|20080815153815.996|CCO|Russian troops, and 
20080815153815.996|20080815153817.753|CCO|any irregular and paramilitary forces 
20080815153817.753|20080815153819.511|CCO|that entered with them, must 
20080815153819.511|20080815153821.269|CCO|leave immediately -- must 
20080815153821.269|20080815153823.026|CCO|leave immediately. 
20080815153823.026|20080815153824.784|CCO|Now Secretary Rice going on to say that 
20080815153824.784|20080815153826.542|CCO|certainly the need is there 
20080815153826.542|20080815153828.300|CCO|for more impartial peacekeepers.

20080815154232.465|20080815154234.119|CCO|Obviously it took some time, much

20080815154258.933|20080815154300.587|CCO|have already signed, the exact

20080815154302.242|20080815154303.896|CCO|So she's saying, as what President Bush 
20080815154303.896|20080815154305.550|CCO|said, that the Russians really 
20080815154305.550|20080815154307.205|CCO|need to honor their word, 
20080815154307.205|20080815154308.859|CCO|they need to get out of Georgia immediately, she 
20080815154308.859|20080815154310.513|CCO|said. 
20080815154310.513|20080815154312.167|CCO|Rice also added that aid now needs

20080815154317.130|20080815154318.785|CCO|She also added too that the international 
20080815154318.785|20080815154320.439|CCO|community would come to Georgia's 
20080815154320.439|20080815154322.093|CCO|aid and that they would help

20080815154330.365|20080815154332.019|CCO|But the United States is making it very 
20080815154332.019|20080815154333.673|CCO|clear, and the President 
20080815154333.673|20080815154335.327|CCO|Saakashvili said the same thing, too, 
20080815154335.327|20080815154336.982|CCO|that South Ossetia and Abkhasia 
20080815154336.982|20080815154338.636|CCO|are part of Georgia. 
20080815154338.636|20080815154340.290|CCO|Now, the Russians are saying today

20080815154343.599|20080815154345.253|CCO|are pro-Russian, they want to be

20080815154355.179|20080815154356.833|CCO|We want to take a moment now to get to 
20080815154356.833|20080815154358.487|CCO|our special correspondent, Frank 
20080815154358.487|20080815154400.142|CCO|Sesno, in Washington about more on 
20080815154400.142|20080815154401.796|CCO|this. 
20080815154401.796|20080815154403.450|CCO|You know, Frank, there are so many interesting 
20080815154403.450|20080815154405.104|CCO|things to talk about 
20080815154405.104|20080815154406.759|CCO|here, even if we just spoke about the 
20080815154406.759|20080815154408.413|CCO|passion that the Georgian president 
20080815154408.413|20080815154410.067|CCO|showed in that press conference. 
20080815154411.722|20080815154413.376|CCO|But particularly, he said, you know, 
20080815154413.376|20080815154415.030|CCO|what I  want to understand is why 
20080815154415.030|20080815154416.684|CCO|this happened in the first place. 
20080815154418.339|20080815154419.993|CCO|My country was screaming and yelling 
20080815154419.993|20080815154421.647|CCO|that Russia was going to 
20080815154421.647|20080815154423.302|CCO|do this. 
20080815154423.302|20080815154424.956|CCO|He says the rest of the world 
20080815154424.956|20080815154426.610|CCO|didn't listen.

20080815154426.610|20080815154428.264|CCO|>> FRANK SESNO, CNN SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT: Well that's what he says, and I  
20080815154428.264|20080815154429.919|CCO|think one of the things that's so 
20080815154429.919|20080815154431.573|CCO|striking about that news conference 
20080815154431.573|20080815154433.227|CCO|we just saw is the raw 
20080815154433.227|20080815154434.882|CCO|emotion from the Georgia president 
20080815154434.882|20080815154436.536|CCO|up against the rather calm 
20080815154436.536|20080815154438.190|CCO|and deliberate but nonetheless 
20080815154438.190|20080815154439.844|CCO|clearly limited demeanor 
20080815154439.844|20080815154441.499|CCO|from Condoleezza Rice, reflecting 
20080815154441.499|20080815154443.153|CCO|the limited options that 
20080815154443.153|20080815154444.807|CCO|the West has right here. 
20080815154444.807|20080815154446.462|CCO|Because they're not going to war, they're not going to go to war 
20080815154446.462|20080815154448.116|CCO|over Georgia. 
20080815154448.116|20080815154449.770|CCO|The Russians, of course, have a different view, 
20080815154449.770|20080815154451.424|CCO|and that is that they've been 
20080815154451.424|20080815154453.079|CCO|provoked in a sense, that they've 
20080815154453.079|20080815154454.733|CCO|endured these abuses in Ossetia 
20080815154454.733|20080815154456.387|CCO|and Abkhasia and they're 
20080815154456.387|20080815154458.042|CCO|responding to that. 
20080815154458.042|20080815154459.696|CCO|These are some of the things that 
20080815154459.696|20080815154501.350|CCO|are going to have to be worked 
20080815154501.350|20080815154503.004|CCO|out. 
20080815154503.004|20080815154504.659|CCO|And this is what makes this so difficult. 
20080815154506.313|20080815154507.967|CCO|Clearly the Russian behavior is not 
20080815154507.967|20080815154509.622|CCO|something that NATO  or the 
20080815154509.622|20080815154511.276|CCO|West or the United States can, or 
20080815154511.276|20080815154512.930|CCO|likely will, stand. 
20080815154512.930|20080815154514.584|CCO|This is not, as the president pointed 
20080815154514.584|20080815154516.239|CCO|out, sort of the way you 
20080815154516.239|20080815154517.893|CCO|operate in a 21st century world. 
20080815154517.893|20080815154519.547|CCO|And the Russians have been spending a 
20080815154519.547|20080815154521.202|CCO|lot of time over the last year 
20080815154521.202|20080815154522.856|CCO|signing onto these rules, dealing 
20080815154522.856|20080815154524.510|CCO|with the G-8,  eight industrialized 
20080815154524.510|20080815154526.164|CCO|nations, working closely 
20080815154526.164|20080815154527.819|CCO|as part of European institutions, 
20080815154527.819|20080815154529.473|CCO|even NATO  to some degree. So this 
20080815154529.473|20080815154531.127|CCO|is a real mess and it's going 
20080815154531.127|20080815154532.782|CCO|to be very difficult for both 
20080815154532.782|20080815154534.436|CCO|sides to get out of it.

20080815154534.436|20080815154536.090|CCO|the point that the Georgian 
20080815154536.090|20080815154537.744|CCO|president made, Condoleezza 
20080815154537.744|20080815154539.399|CCO|Rice then followed up by talking 
20080815154539.399|20080815154541.053|CCO|a little bit about consequences to the 
20080815154541.053|20080815154542.707|CCO|Russians. What will those consequences, 
20080815154542.707|20080815154544.362|CCO|if any, end up being? 
20080815154546.016|20080815154547.670|CCO|Ones that make sense. 
20080815154546.016|20080815154642.261|NER_01|Person=Frank Sesno|Role=CNN SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
20080815154546.016|20080815154547.670|CCO|>> SESNO: Well there will be -- it's 
20080815154547.670|20080815154549.324|CCO|quite likely that there will -- first 
20080815154549.324|20080815154550.979|CCO|of all, there will be political consequences. 
20080815154550.979|20080815154552.633|CCO|Those have already taken place. 
20080815154552.633|20080815154554.287|CCO|Just the whole tenor has taken changed. Listen 
20080815154554.287|20080815154555.942|CCO|to words of the Defense Secretary Bob Gates yesterday when 
20080815154555.942|20080815154557.596|CCO|he said, "Russia's behavior over the past week has called 
20080815154557.596|20080815154559.250|CCO|into question the entire premise 
20080815154559.250|20080815154600.904|CCO|of the dialogue." 
20080815154600.904|20080815154602.559|CCO|I  mean, that's a soup to nuts kind 
20080815154602.559|20080815154604.213|CCO|of thing. 
20080815154604.213|20080815154605.867|CCO|And remember that both Gates and Condi 
20080815154605.867|20080815154607.522|CCO|Rice were in the first Bush 
20080815154607.522|20080815154609.176|CCO|administration as Kremlin experts. 
20080815154610.830|20080815154612.484|CCO|So they're well versed in Kremlin 
20080815154612.484|20080815154614.139|CCO|politics and in the Cold 
20080815154614.139|20080815154615.793|CCO|War. 
20080815154615.793|20080815154617.447|CCO|And so this is very dicey business. 
20080815154617.447|20080815154619.101|CCO|So the first thing is going to be 
20080815154619.101|20080815154620.756|CCO|a political fallout, a diplomatic 
20080815154620.756|20080815154622.410|CCO|fallout. 
20080815154622.410|20080815154624.064|CCO|There could well be economic fallout if 
20080815154624.064|20080815154625.719|CCO|the Russians are pushed out or 
20080815154625.719|20080815154627.373|CCO|marginalized in the Group of 8.  
20080815154627.373|20080815154629.027|CCO|But 
20080815154629.027|20080815154630.681|CCO|there's cost on the other side, too. She's 
20080815154632.336|20080815154633.990|CCO|talking about how NATO,  
20080815154633.990|20080815154635.644|CCO|the alliance, is going to take up where this goes.
