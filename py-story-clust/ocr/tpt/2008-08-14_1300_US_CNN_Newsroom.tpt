20080814130729.696|20080814130732.451|CCO|Pentagon officials confirming a 
20080814130732.451|20080814130735.206|CCO|second military aid flight did 
20080814130735.206|20080814130737.961|CCO|land in Tbilisi earlier today. 
20080814130737.961|20080814130740.715|CCO|But at the moment, they are waiting for 
20080814130740.715|20080814130743.470|CCO|a military assessment team to 
20080814130743.470|20080814130746.225|CCO|report back on what exactly is needed. So the full flow of humanitarian relief, perhaps, is still to come. 
20080814130746.225|20080814130748.980|CCO|A  lot of this -- the fighting, the 
20080814130748.980|20080814130751.735|CCO|humanitarian relief -- all really is dependent on what 
20080814130751.735|20080814130754.490|CCO|U.S.  intelligence can really gather about the situation on the ground. In fact, U.S.  officials confirmed to CNN  
20080814130754.490|20080814130757.245|CCO|that over 
20080814130757.245|20080814130800.000|CCO|the weekend they redeployed, redirected and sent some 
20080814130800.000|20080814130802.755|CCO|intelligence assets 
20080814130802.755|20080814130805.510|CCO|over Georgia. We believe they are satellites to have a 
20080814130805.510|20080814130808.264|CCO|look at the situation on the ground 
20080814130808.264|20080814130811.019|CCO|and try and develop some independent U.S.  
20080814130811.019|20080814130813.774|CCO|intelligence about Russian military moves and what the situation really is. 
20080814130816.529|20080814130819.284|CCO|Defense Secretary Robert Gates will be in the briefing room about an hour and a half from now to speak with reporters. It will be the first U.S.  
20080814130819.284|20080814130822.039|CCO|military statement on the record, on camera about this unfolding situation -- Heidi.

20080814130838.313|20080814130840.813|CCO|the city of Gori. 
20080814130840.813|20080814130843.312|CCO|It has been a nerve center of rising tensions, and to some degree remains in limbo even today. CNN's Michael Ware is there and spoke

20080814130848.312|20080814130850.811|CCO|>> MICHAEL WARE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I'm literally standing on, for 
20080814130850.811|20080814130853.311|CCO|what it's worth, the front line 
20080814130853.311|20080814130855.811|CCO|in this conflict. 
20080814130855.811|20080814130858.310|CCO|Where I  am at this moment is virtually 
20080814130858.310|20080814130900.810|CCO|on the city limits of 
20080814130900.810|20080814130903.310|CCO|that flash point city that you 
20080814130903.310|20080814130905.809|CCO|referred to -- Gori. Now 
20080814130905.809|20080814130908.309|CCO|just moments ago Russian special forces 
20080814130908.309|20080814130910.809|CCO|troops were right here and they've only just moved back into the city. So 
20080814130910.809|20080814130913.308|CCO|we can confirm that despite confusing and contradictory reports 
20080814130913.308|20080814130915.808|CCO|coming from all sides, that Russian forces, as of this 
20080814130915.808|20080814130918.307|CCO|moment, remain in control of the city of Gori. Now this untold number 
20080814130920.807|20080814130923.307|CCO|of 
20080814130923.307|20080814130925.806|CCO|reports of what's going on in 
20080814130925.806|20080814130928.306|CCO|the city and within its outskirts, 
20080814130928.306|20080814130930.806|CCO|none of which are able 
20080814130930.806|20080814130933.305|CCO|to be confirmed. 
20080814130933.305|20080814130935.805|CCO|However, there had been a number 
20080814130935.805|20080814130938.305|CCO|of car jackings of journalists and others 
20080814130938.305|20080814130940.804|CCO|who have attempted to enter 
20080814130940.804|20080814130943.304|CCO|the city. 
20080814130943.304|20080814130945.804|CCO|And for now, the Russians have put a firm roadblock and it's preventing any entry into the city of Gori. Now this 
20080814130950.803|20080814130953.303|CCO|by and large cut Georgia's 
20080814130953.303|20080814130955.802|CCO|main artery from its capital Tbilisi to its port town. Now 
20080814130955.802|20080814130958.302|CCO|if you recall President Bush has stated categorically that 
20080814130958.302|20080814131000.801|CCO|the U.S.  expects Russia to maintain 
20080814131000.801|20080814131003.301|CCO|the lines of communication 
20080814131003.301|20080814131005.801|CCO|for humanitarian assistance, including the 
20080814131005.801|20080814131008.300|CCO|seaport. 
20080814131008.300|20080814131010.800|CCO|Now cutting this major artery certainly 
20080814131010.800|20080814131013.300|CCO|inhibits that access. 
20080814131013.300|20080814131015.799|CCO|While there are several other routes, this 
20080814131015.799|20080814131018.299|CCO|very much is the main artery that humanitarian 
20080814131018.299|20080814131020.799|CCO|aid would most likely use running in to the capital Tbilisi. But what 
20080814131020.799|20080814131023.298|CCO|we can tell you, as I  repeat, is that the 
20080814131023.298|20080814131025.798|CCO|Russian forces are firmly in 
20080814131025.798|20080814131028.298|CCO|control of the Georgian 
20080814131028.298|20080814131030.797|CCO|city of Gori, which is just 
20080814131030.797|20080814131033.297|CCO|outside one of the two disputed

20080814131035.797|20080814131038.296|CCO|that's right. 
20080814131038.296|20080814131040.796|CCO|But just to clarify you, Michael, 
20080814131040.796|20080814131043.295|CCO|Gori is actually in Georgian country proper, if you like. It's not in that 
20080814131043.295|20080814131045.795|CCO|break away province of South Ossetia. 
20080814131048.295|20080814131050.794|CCO|Now we've been hearing reports over the last two or three hours of explosions rocking the 
20080814131050.794|20080814131053.294|CCO|city of Gori. I  
20080814131053.294|20080814131055.794|CCO|don't know whether you are in an area where you could hear or whether you've been able to confirm anything that's been happening as far as those explosions are concerned.

20080814131053.294|20080814131055.794|CCO|>> WARE: 
20080814131055.794|20080814131058.293|CCO|Well, I  can't tell you that there's 
20080814131058.293|20080814131100.793|CCO|a number of dark smoke flames 
20080814131100.793|20080814131103.293|CCO|that are arriving in and around 
20080814131103.293|20080814131105.792|CCO|the area of the city. 
20080814131105.792|20080814131108.292|CCO|I  cannot account for what they are. 
20080814131110.792|20080814131113.291|CCO|But what we're hearing from both 
20080814131113.291|20080814131115.791|CCO|sides most recently is that those explosions 
20080814131115.791|20080814131118.290|CCO|are controlled detonations of 
20080814131118.290|20080814131120.790|CCO|munitions. It's impossible to confirm that. However, on 
20080814131120.790|20080814131123.290|CCO|the approach leading to this 
20080814131123.290|20080814131125.789|CCO|city, you can see, for what it's 
20080814131125.789|20080814131128.289|CCO|worth, a rag tag series of columns 
20080814131128.289|20080814131130.789|CCO|of Georgian military. 
20080814131130.789|20080814131133.288|CCO|Now it's a mix of infantry, some very light armor, some artillery patients, and 
20080814131133.288|20080814131135.788|CCO|amounts to more than perhaps a 
20080814131135.788|20080814131138.288|CCO|brigade against what's amassed from the Russian army which is far superior. So by 
20080814131138.288|20080814131140.787|CCO|and large, the route to the capital 
20080814131140.787|20080814131143.287|CCO|Tbilisi is well and truly 
20080814131143.287|20080814131145.787|CCO|open to the Russians. 
20080814131145.787|20080814131148.286|CCO|And the forces that we've seen are in 
20080814131148.286|20080814131150.786|CCO|no position to defend either this 
20080814131150.786|20080814131153.286|CCO|road nor the capital itself.

20080814132350.432|20080814132352.071|CCO|well -- inflation is running at 5.6

20080814132434.704|20080814132436.344|CCO|Nevada still leads the country. California is second, 
20080814132436.344|20080814132437.984|CCO|although it's got the highest number

You know, you've heard us talk about oil. This is a map behind me about some oil pipelines that go through that region including Georgia. And 
20080814133423.718|20080814133425.525|CCO|you know, as we've been reporting, the pipe has been shut down in the middle of this 
20080814133425.525|20080814133427.332|CCO|conflict. But what 
20080814133427.332|20080814133429.139|CCO|I  want to do now is take you 
20080814133429.139|20080814133430.946|CCO|over to this other screen behind 
20080814133430.946|20080814133432.753|CCO|me on my other side. And we're going to show 
20080814133432.753|20080814133434.560|CCO|you some of the startling statistics you were talking about there. How much Europe gets 
20080814133434.560|20080814133436.367|CCO|its oil from Russia? 
20080814133436.367|20080814133438.174|CCO|Let's start with this first one right 
20080814133438.174|20080814133439.981|CCO|here where talks about Russia 
20080814133439.981|20080814133441.788|CCO|in general. 
20080814133441.788|20080814133443.595|CCO|It has the world's largest natural gas 
20080814133443.595|20080814133445.402|CCO|reserves and of all nation's in the world, the eighth 
20080814133445.402|20080814133447.209|CCO|largest oil reserve. 
20080814133447.209|20080814133449.016|CCO|That's from the U.S.  Energy Information Administration. This next one now, 29  percent of Europe's 
20080814133449.016|20080814133450.823|CCO|oil imports come from Russia. 
20080814133452.630|20080814133454.437|CCO|That's a massive amount. 
20080814133454.437|20080814133456.244|CCO|This is European nations as a group. 
20080814133458.051|20080814133459.858|CCO|Now, natural gas, sometimes even 
20080814133459.858|20080814133501.665|CCO|more -- these are broken done by nation. Germany gets about a 
20080814133501.665|20080814133503.472|CCO|third. 
20080814133503.472|20080814133505.279|CCO|Turkey about two-thirds of its natural gas from Russia. France, 
20080814133505.279|20080814133507.086|CCO|20  percent. Finland 
20080814133507.086|20080814133508.893|CCO|is one of the countries that 
20080814133508.893|20080814133510.700|CCO|gets all of its natural gas. I  
20080814133510.700|20080814133512.507|CCO|saw a private analysis that said 
20080814133512.507|20080814133514.314|CCO|in total, European nations are about getting 
20080814133514.314|20080814133516.121|CCO|half their natural gas from Russia. 
20080814133517.928|20080814133519.735|CCO|So again, massive ties in that sense. 
20080814133519.735|20080814133521.542|CCO|Let's go to this last one which gives you a summary from Energy Information Administration. They tell you that Russia's economic 
20080814133521.542|20080814133523.349|CCO|growth really throughout 
20080814133523.349|20080814133525.156|CCO|this decade has been driven number one -- issue number one there, driven 
20080814133525.156|20080814133526.963|CCO|primarily by energy exports. 
20080814133528.770|20080814133530.577|CCO|So basically this is where Russia's focus has 
20080814133530.577|20080814133532.384|CCO|been. 
20080814133532.384|20080814133534.191|CCO|It has succeeded at building a lot of ties 
20080814133534.191|20080814133535.998|CCO|to the west particularly to 
20080814133535.998|20080814133537.805|CCO|Europe. 
20080814133537.805|20080814133539.612|CCO|And this is something that Europe needs 
20080814133539.612|20080814133541.419|CCO|to not mess with too much because 
20080814133541.419|20080814133543.226|CCO|they need to continue to 
20080814133543.226|20080814133545.033|CCO|get those imports.

20080814133554.068|20080814133555.875|CCO|want to go over to it for a second because the United States also gets oil from Russia, but nowhere near as much as Europe does. This
