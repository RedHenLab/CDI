20080815140031.457|20080815140033.119|CCO|>> REYNOLDS WOLF, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Absolutely. 
20080815140034.780|20080815140036.442|CCO|You know, it's always this time of year we 
20080815140036.442|20080815140038.104|CCO|have to keep a sharp eye on the tropics. 
20080815140039.766|20080815140041.427|CCO|Right now, we're watching this area, right near Puerto 
20080815140041.427|20080815140043.089|CCO|Rico, San Juan. You can see the Dominican Republic 
20080815140043.089|20080815140044.751|CCO|and back towards Haiti. 
20080815140044.751|20080815140046.412|CCO|We've got some scattered showers, a few 
20080815140046.412|20080815140048.074|CCO|storms there. You're seeing a 
20080815140048.074|20080815140049.736|CCO|little bit of moisture right near Haiti that's being kicked 
20080815140049.736|20080815140051.398|CCO|up just from one of the sides, just helping 
20080815140051.398|20080815140053.059|CCO|push a few waves right near there. 
20080815140053.059|20080815140054.721|CCO|In the higher elevations, it's going to interact 
20080815140054.721|20080815140056.383|CCO|with that cooler air. 
20080815140056.383|20080815140058.045|CCO|You have that 
20080815140056.383|20080815140058.045|CCO|(INAUDIBLE)
20080815140056.383|20080815140058.045|CCO|you have the rain. 
20080815140058.045|20080815140059.706|CCO|The thing is, we're going to see more 
20080815140059.706|20080815140101.368|CCO|of that, even though right now 
20080815140101.368|20080815140103.030|CCO|we don't have any watches or warnings 
20080815140103.030|20080815140104.691|CCO|there in effect at this point. I  can tell you that people happen to be say in 
20080815140104.691|20080815140106.353|CCO|San Juan or in southern part of Puerto Rico 
20080815140106.353|20080815140108.015|CCO|this hour are certainly going to be dealing with 
20080815140108.015|20080815140109.677|CCO|this heavy rainfall, some heavy surf in the southern end of the island. And as 
20080815140109.677|20080815140111.338|CCO|the system draws its way a little bit to the north 
20080815140111.338|20080815140113.000|CCO|and to the northwest and some locations 
20080815140113.000|20080815140114.662|CCO|just to the west, the Dominican 
20080815140114.662|20080815140116.324|CCO|Republic, that rain is 
20080815140116.324|20080815140117.985|CCO|going to intensify. 
20080815140117.985|20080815140119.647|CCO|Something that we have to watch very carefully. Now, I  can also tell you that our 
20080815140119.647|20080815140121.309|CCO|friends at the National Hurricane 
20080815140121.309|20080815140122.970|CCO|Center are going to be 
20080815140122.970|20080815140124.632|CCO|sending in quite a few planes, reconnaissance aircraft 
20080815140124.632|20080815140126.294|CCO|to the system to take a better look at 
20080815140126.294|20080815140127.956|CCO|it as we get to the afternoon 
20080815140127.956|20080815140129.617|CCO|hours, looking for that center of 
20080815140129.617|20080815140131.279|CCO|circulation. 
20080815140131.279|20080815140132.941|CCO|This is a non-tropical depression at this point. It is not 
20080815140132.941|20080815140134.603|CCO|a tropical 
20080815140134.603|20080815140136.264|CCO|storm, certainly not a hurricane but there 
20080815140136.264|20080815140137.926|CCO|is every possibility that could 
20080815140137.926|20080815140139.588|CCO|indeed occur as we make your 
20080815140139.588|20080815140141.249|CCO|way closer into the weekend. 
20080815140141.249|20080815140142.911|CCO|Now, in terms of the path, in terms of the computer 
20080815140142.911|20080815140144.573|CCO|models, they do vary quite 
20080815140144.573|20080815140146.235|CCO|a bit from place to place. 
20080815140146.235|20080815140147.896|CCO|However, most of them are in agreement that the storm is 
20080815140147.896|20080815140149.558|CCO|expected to go west and then pull 
20080815140149.558|20080815140151.220|CCO|a little bit more to the northwest. 
20080815140151.220|20080815140152.882|CCO|Some of the models have it going 
20080815140152.882|20080815140154.543|CCO|towards the Florida keys, into say, the straits of Florida and some back 
20080815140154.543|20080815140156.205|CCO|over towards say the Bahamas and 
20080815140156.205|20080815140157.867|CCO|some of them even farther north towards the 
20080815140157.867|20080815140159.529|CCO|Georgia or Carolina coast. 
20080815140201.190|20080815140202.852|CCO|There's a lot that can happen with 
20080815140202.852|20080815140204.514|CCO|these systems especially as it interacts 
20080815140204.514|20080815140206.175|CCO|with land. 
20080815140206.175|20080815140207.837|CCO|As it moves a little bit to the north. If it 
20080815140207.837|20080815140209.499|CCO|does follow that path, that goes back over to the warm ocean water. That center 
20080815140209.499|20080815140211.161|CCO|of circulation, if it stays 
20080815140211.161|20080815140212.822|CCO|in that area, could certainly 
20080815140212.822|20080815140214.484|CCO|intensify. 
20080815140214.484|20080815140216.146|CCO|We could see this thing really develop, 
20080815140216.146|20080815140217.808|CCO|gain some strength, especially 
20080815140217.808|20080815140219.469|CCO|over the next 12 
20080815140219.469|20080815140221.131|CCO| to 24  to 48  hours. 
20080815140221.131|20080815140222.793|CCO|So there is something that we need to watch very carefully. Again, Heidi, I  don't want to sound 
20080815140222.793|20080815140224.454|CCO|like I  continue to beat the 
20080815140224.454|20080815140226.116|CCO|drum, but it is the time of year 
20080815140226.116|20080815140227.778|CCO|that people along all the coastlines, along the eastern 
20080815140227.778|20080815140229.440|CCO|seaboard, especially in Florida 
20080815140229.440|20080815140231.101|CCO|and the Gulf of Mexico, need

20080815141109.790|20080815141111.567|CCO|forces. 
20080815141111.567|20080815141113.344|CCO|What we're hearing from Georgian 
20080815141113.344|20080815141115.120|CCO|officials is apparently there are 
20080815141115.120|20080815141116.897|CCO|no Russian tanks or Russian troops in 
20080815141116.897|20080815141118.674|CCO|the center of town. 
20080815141118.674|20080815141120.451|CCO|However, they are telling us that 
20080815141120.451|20080815141122.227|CCO|there are Russian forces controlling

20080815141131.111|20080815141132.887|CCO|They say that the Russian forces

20080815141136.441|20080815141138.217|CCO|Now, what we're hearing from the Georgian

20080815141139.994|20080815141141.771|CCO|in negotiations with the

20080815144947.171|20080815144948.825|CCO|to be about Hillary, obviously, 
20080815144948.825|20080815144950.479|CCO|putting her name in for 
20080815144950.479|20080815144952.133|CCO|nomination.

20080815144955.441|20080815144957.095|CCO|Bill Press, I'll begin with you. 
20080815144957.095|20080815144958.749|CCO|You know what? 
20080815144958.749|20080815145000.403|CCO|I  think it's a bad idea. 
20080815145000.403|20080815145002.057|CCO|I'm an Obama supporter. 
20080815145002.057|20080815145003.711|CCO|But, I  don't see why -- look, we had a very 
20080815145003.711|20080815145005.365|CCO|healthy primary process, God knows 
20080815145005.365|20080815145007.020|CCO|it was long enough. Obama 
20080815145007.020|20080815145008.674|CCO|won and Hillary lost. 
20080815145008.674|20080815145010.328|CCO|And to go to the convention now and re-open that 
20080815145010.328|20080815145011.982|CCO|debate I  think is like 
20080815145011.982|20080815145013.636|CCO|ripping a scab off an old wound

20080815145040.101|20080815145041.755|CCO|But, let me stay with Bill's metaphor. 
20080815145043.409|20080815145045.063|CCO|We're ripping the scab off. 
20080815145045.063|20080815145046.717|CCO|She says that her folks wanted catharsis. Do 
20080815145048.371|20080815145050.025|CCO|you remember Greek tragedy? 
20080815145050.025|20080815145051.679|CCO|Catharsis usually happens on the

20080815145054.987|20080815145056.641|CCO|But the notion they will stick to the 
20080815145056.641|20080815145058.295|CCO|script and this will unify the 
20080815145058.295|20080815145059.949|CCO|party -- we're talking about the

20080815145246.847|20080815145248.455|CCO|That first part where he said it advantaged McCain. The interesting thing about this 
20080815145248.455|20080815145250.064|CCO|to me is when this broke. I  said, you know, we've 
20080815145250.064|20080815145251.673|CCO|been talking about China and 
20080815145251.673|20080815145253.281|CCO|other things on the radio show. Who's 
20080815145253.281|20080815145254.890|CCO|been talking about Russia 
20080815145254.890|20080815145256.498|CCO|and seeing this coming? 
20080815145256.498|20080815145258.107|CCO|A  couple of people, Bob Kagan was one, 
20080815145259.716|20080815145301.324|CCO|a couple of Democrats were actually 
20080815145301.324|20080815145302.933|CCO|talking about it, Richard

20080815145304.542|20080815145306.150|CCO|But John McCain's been talking about 
20080815145306.150|20080815145307.759|CCO|it for two or three years and so 
20080815145307.759|20080815145309.368|CCO|credit to him for seeing that. 
20080815145310.976|20080815145312.585|CCO|He's understood what's going on in 
20080815145312.585|20080815145314.194|CCO|Russia, he's understood Putin and he has predicted 
20080815145314.194|20080815145315.802|CCO|this. 
20080815145315.802|20080815145317.411|CCO|I  think his position was strong and 
20080815145317.411|20080815145319.019|CCO|clear. 
20080815145319.019|20080815145320.628|CCO|Obama was shaky at first but has 
20080815145320.628|20080815145322.237|CCO|now fallen in, as Bill said, behind 
20080815145322.237|20080815145323.845|CCO|the President and in line 
20080815145323.845|20080815145325.454|CCO|with what John McCain has been saying. I  
20080815145325.454|20080815145327.063|CCO|think -- I 
20080815145327.063|20080815145328.671|CCO| only think this -- I  don't mean 
20080815145328.671|20080815145330.280|CCO|to score a cheap point on this. But, 
20080815145330.280|20080815145331.889|CCO|these situations remind 
20080815145331.889|20080815145333.497|CCO|you of what it means to be 
20080815145333.497|20080815145335.106|CCO|a president, as the commander in chief. 
20080815145336.715|20080815145338.323|CCO|And I  think McCain has sounded and looked 
20080815145338.323|20080815145339.932|CCO|very good on this and Barack 
20080815145339.932|20080815145341.540|CCO|Obama a little unsteady, understandable,

20080815145344.758|20080815145346.366|CCO|you know, Bill, I  think in all fairness, 
20080815145346.366|20080815145347.975|CCO|if Barack Obama had sent

20080815145407.279|20080815145408.887|CCO|The problem with the Susan Rice was that she 
20080815145408.887|20080815145410.496|CCO|started by attacking John McCain

Never a good thing. But, for Apache, the situation was dire. Vets discovered the fork had pierced a vein in his chest and was causing bleeding around his lungs. They rushed Apache into surgery, removed the fork and gave him multiple blood transfusions. We are now happy to report Apache survived and is doing great.
