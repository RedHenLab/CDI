20080811152419.963|20080811152421.443|CCO|could be it for

20080811152422.923|20080811152424.402|CCO|could be on his way out. 
20080811152424.402|20080811152425.882|CCO|He does have a few options. 
20080811152425.882|20080811152427.362|CCO|The first thing he could do is try and block 
20080811152427.362|20080811152428.841|CCO|a two-thirds majority vote

20080811152431.801|20080811152433.281|CCO|against him on that one. 
20080811152434.760|20080811152436.240|CCO|He could also resign, or he could 
20080811152436.240|20080811152437.720|CCO|use his powers as president, dismiss

20080811155248.480|20080811155250.188|CCO|>> CHANCE: Thanks, Brianna. Well actually, we're 
20080811155250.188|20080811155251.895|CCO|just driving out of Gori because 
20080811155251.895|20080811155253.602|CCO|there's a whole convoy of 
20080811155253.602|20080811155255.310|CCO|civilian and military vehicles 
20080811155255.310|20080811155257.017|CCO|that has been flooding 
20080811155257.017|20080811155258.724|CCO|out of that city in -- just a short distance 
20080811155258.724|20080811155300.432|CCO|from the South Ossetia conflict 
20080811155300.432|20080811155302.139|CCO|zone. 
20080811155302.139|20080811155303.846|CCO|I've just had it confirmed by Georgian 
20080811155303.846|20080811155305.554|CCO|officials that according 
20080811155305.554|20080811155307.261|CCO|to them. Gori is in the 
20080811155307.261|20080811155308.968|CCO|process of falling to Russian forces. 
20080811155310.676|20080811155312.383|CCO|Apparently Russian infantry units 
20080811155312.383|20080811155314.090|CCO|are approaching the outskirts 
20080811155314.090|20080811155315.798|CCO|of the city and have actually 
20080811155315.798|20080811155317.505|CCO|entered the 
20080811155317.505|20080811155319.212|CCO|city according to Georgian officials. 
20080811155319.212|20080811155320.920|CCO|Now, this is significant because this 
20080811155320.920|20080811155322.627|CCO|is a city that is outside the immediate 
20080811155322.627|20080811155324.334|CCO|conflict zone of South 
20080811155324.334|20080811155326.042|CCO|Ossetia. 
20080811155326.042|20080811155327.749|CCO|It's very close to South Ossetia. 
20080811155329.456|20080811155331.164|CCO|It's the place where you know, there's a Georgian 
20080811155331.164|20080811155332.871|CCO|military garrison. And so lots 
20080811155332.871|20080811155334.578|CCO|of military operations have 
20080811155334.578|20080811155336.286|CCO|been conducted out of Gori by the 
20080811155336.286|20080811155337.993|CCO|Georgian forces. 
20080811155337.993|20080811155339.700|CCO|That may be one of the reasons why 
20080811155339.700|20080811155341.408|CCO|the Russian military have turned 
20080811155341.408|20080811155343.115|CCO|their attention to it at this 
20080811155343.115|20080811155344.822|CCO|stage. But the point is at the 
20080811155344.822|20080811155346.530|CCO|moment, it's being evacuated by 
20080811155346.530|20080811155348.237|CCO|Georgian forces. 
20080811155348.237|20080811155349.944|CCO|They're moving out their artillery, 
20080811155349.944|20080811155351.652|CCO|their tanks, their personnel, 
20080811155351.652|20080811155353.359|CCO|to a location -- a fallback 
20080811155353.359|20080811155355.066|CCO|location closer to the Georgia 
20080811155355.066|20080811155356.774|CCO|capital Tbilisi. And many 
20080811155356.774|20080811155358.481|CCO|civilians are also making their way out 
20080811155358.481|20080811155400.188|CCO|of the city. those that were 
20080811155400.188|20080811155401.896|CCO|left there. 
20080811155401.896|20080811155403.603|CCO|Because remember, this is a city, this is a town that 
20080811155403.603|20080811155405.310|CCO|has been under frequent bombardment 
20080811155405.310|20080811155407.018|CCO|by Russian war planes 
20080811155407.018|20080811155408.725|CCO|over the course of the past 
20080811155408.725|20080811155410.432|CCO|several days, since hostilities 
20080811155410.432|20080811155412.140|CCO|broke out. 
20080811155412.140|20080811155413.847|CCO|And so, there aren't that many civilians 
20080811155413.847|20080811155415.554|CCO|there anymore. 
20080811155415.554|20080811155417.262|CCO|But those that were there, many of them 
20080811155417.262|20080811155418.969|CCO|are now making their way out

20080811155425.798|20080811155427.506|CCO|You can see just southeast there 
20080811155427.506|20080811155429.213|CCO|of Gori, is Tbilisi. Which is the 
20080811155429.213|20080811155430.920|CCO|capital of Georgia. 
20080811155430.920|20080811155432.628|CCO|So Matthew, the question is, is 
20080811155432.628|20080811155434.335|CCO|this the beginning of Russian forces 
20080811155434.335|20080811155436.042|CCO|moving into the capital? 
20080811155436.042|20080811155437.750|CCO|That is certainly the concern of

20080811155444.579|20080811155446.286|CCO|not necessarily happening.

20080811155508.482|20080811155510.189|CCO|It could be that they're just taking
