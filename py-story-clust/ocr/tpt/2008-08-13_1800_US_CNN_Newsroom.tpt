20080813180458.677|20080813180500.396|CCO|>> PAMELA SMITH, KATV REPORTER: Well, Anne, what we know from our vantage point, which 
20080813180500.396|20080813180502.115|CCO|we are being kept 
20080813180502.115|20080813180503.835|CCO|at quite a distance by police, obviously, because 
20080813180503.835|20080813180505.554|CCO|the investigation is ongoing, 
20080813180505.554|20080813180507.273|CCO|but the suspect, as you mentioned 
20080813180507.273|20080813180508.992|CCO|already, was loaded into 
20080813180508.992|20080813180510.711|CCO|an ambulance. 
20080813180510.711|20080813180512.430|CCO|And there were several attempts to resuscitate him. 
20080813180514.149|20080813180515.869|CCO|We don't know his exact status, 
20080813180515.869|20080813180517.588|CCO|but I  did overhear police commenting 
20080813180517.588|20080813180519.307|CCO|that they were going to 
20080813180519.307|20080813180521.026|CCO|attempt to med-flight him. 
20080813180521.026|20080813180522.745|CCO|But this is a very woody area, so they're 
20080813180522.745|20080813180524.464|CCO|trying to get some things 
20080813180524.464|20080813180526.183|CCO|worked out logistically to 
20080813180526.183|20080813180527.902|CCO|be able to accomplish that, 
20080813180527.902|20080813180529.622|CCO|to get the suspect airlifted to 
20080813180529.622|20080813180531.341|CCO|one of the local hospitals. 
20080813180531.341|20080813180533.060|CCO|But there is quite a seen here, as you 
20080813180533.060|20080813180534.779|CCO|imagine, down Little Creek cutoff, 
20080813180534.779|20080813180536.498|CCO|where the high-speed chase came to 
20080813180536.498|20080813180538.217|CCO|an end. 
20080813180538.217|20080813180539.936|CCO|Authorities from multiple law enforcement agencies are still on the scene 
20080813180539.936|20080813180541.656|CCO|as we speak. 
20080813180541.656|20080813180543.375|CCO|In fact, many of these law enforcement officials 
20080813180543.375|20080813180545.094|CCO|followed the suspect out 
20080813180545.094|20080813180546.813|CCO|of Little Rock, as we've already 
20080813180546.813|20080813180548.532|CCO|mentioned, into Grant County, 
20080813180548.532|20080813180550.251|CCO|going through several counties, 
20080813180550.251|20080813180551.970|CCO|at speeds that often reached 
20080813180551.970|20080813180553.690|CCO|100  miles per hour. 
20080813180553.690|20080813180555.409|CCO|Quite a few neighbors here in the 
20080813180555.409|20080813180557.128|CCO|area were shocked and surprised, 
20080813180557.128|20080813180558.847|CCO|as you might imagine. 
20080813180558.847|20080813180600.566|CCO|One gentleman told me he was asleep 
20080813180600.566|20080813180602.285|CCO|inside his home when he heard 
20080813180602.285|20080813180604.004|CCO|all of the commotion outside. 
20080813180605.723|20080813180607.443|CCO|But again, don't know much about 
20080813180607.443|20080813180609.162|CCO|the suspect. 
20080813180609.162|20080813180610.881|CCO|All we know is that he is a white 
20080813180610.881|20080813180612.600|CCO|male. 
20080813180612.600|20080813180614.319|CCO|He was shot during some sort of exchange. 
20080813180616.038|20080813180617.757|CCO|We have not been able to confirm 
20080813180617.757|20080813180619.477|CCO|whether or not police and the suspect 
20080813180619.477|20080813180621.196|CCO|actually exchanged gunfire, 
20080813180622.915|20080813180624.634|CCO|but we do know the suspect was wounded. 
20080813180626.353|20080813180628.072|CCO|He was driving a blue Dodge, which 
20080813180628.072|20080813180629.791|CCO|pealed out just off Little Creek Road 
20080813180629.791|20080813180631.510|CCO|and is wrecked against a tree. 
20080813180633.230|20080813180634.949|CCO|Authorities are still there combing the area, searching for any evidence that might help them try to figure out exactly what

20080813180820.216|20080813180822.266|CCO|>> FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, right 
20080813180822.266|20080813180824.316|CCO|now, Don, the cease-fire appears 
20080813180824.316|20080813180826.366|CCO|to be holding. 
20080813180826.366|20080813180828.416|CCO|Certainly the two sides, at least, aren't shooting at 
20080813180828.416|20080813180830.465|CCO|each other at this point. 
20080813180830.465|20080813180832.515|CCO|Nevertheless, the Georgian government 
20080813180832.515|20080813180834.565|CCO|is accusing the Russians 
20080813180834.565|20080813180836.615|CCO|of breaching that cease-fire agreement 
20080813180836.615|20080813180838.665|CCO|that has been in effect 
20080813180838.665|20080813180840.715|CCO|between these two sides since 
20080813180840.715|20080813180842.765|CCO|the late evening hours of yesterday 
20080813180842.765|20080813180844.815|CCO|evening. 
20080813180844.815|20080813180846.865|CCO|And the reason they say that is because 
20080813180846.865|20080813180848.914|CCO|earlier today, a column of 
20080813180848.914|20080813180850.964|CCO|Russian armored vehicles and armored personnel carriers made 
20080813180850.964|20080813180853.014|CCO|its way across, towards the Georgian 
20080813180853.014|20080813180855.064|CCO|capital of Tbilisi from a position it had further back towards that breakaway republic of Southern Ossetia. It 
20080813180855.064|20080813180857.114|CCO|was making its way here towards the capital. Then 
20080813180857.114|20080813180859.164|CCO|that convoy stopped, veered off in a different location, and took 
20080813180859.164|20080813180901.214|CCO|up a location somewhere else. 
20080813180901.214|20080813180903.264|CCO|Now, the Georgian government says those 
20080813180903.264|20080813180905.314|CCO|tanks moving in the direction 
20080813180905.314|20080813180907.363|CCO|of the capital is a direct 
20080813180907.363|20080813180909.413|CCO|breach of that cease-fire agreement because that 
20080813180911.463|20080813180913.513|CCO|cease-fire agreement calls for both sides 
20080813180913.513|20080813180915.563|CCO|to remain in their position at 
20080813180915.563|20080813180917.613|CCO|this point in time. And you were saying exactly right, 
20080813180917.613|20080813180919.663|CCO|the rhetoric between these two nations 
20080813180919.663|20080813180921.713|CCO|still very much ramped up. 
20080813180923.763|20080813180925.812|CCO|Both sides accusing each other of

20080813182159.728|20080813182201.408|CCO|Right. 
20080813182201.408|20080813182203.089|CCO|I  mean, let me just say first off, there 
20080813182203.089|20080813182204.769|CCO|is no evidence that that has happened. 
20080813182206.449|20080813182208.130|CCO|But there are a lot of theories floating 
20080813182208.130|20080813182209.810|CCO|around here. 
20080813182209.810|20080813182211.490|CCO|And one of them is that the Anthonys have 
20080813182211.490|20080813182213.171|CCO|this above-ground 
20080813182213.171|20080813182214.851|CCO|pool in the back yard, and they 
20080813182214.851|20080813182216.531|CCO|remove this ladder when the 
20080813182216.531|20080813182218.212|CCO|pool isn't in use to make sure that Caylee 
20080813182218.212|20080813182219.892|CCO|can't get into the pool. 
20080813182219.892|20080813182221.572|CCO|And in the days after her disappearance, 
20080813182221.572|20080813182223.253|CCO|apparently that ladder 
20080813182223.253|20080813182224.933|CCO|was back at the pool. 
20080813182224.933|20080813182226.614|CCO|So there was some question and some concern that maybe Caylee put 
20080813182226.614|20080813182228.294|CCO|the ladder up, or maybe she got into the 
20080813182228.294|20080813182229.974|CCO|pool somehow, 
20080813182229.974|20080813182231.655|CCO|and maybe Casey was asleep in the house and she panicked. And 
20080813182231.655|20080813182233.335|CCO|there was this flurry of phone calls 
20080813182233.335|20080813182235.015|CCO|that day to her parents, the grandparents of Caylee. And maybe that is what happened. But again, 
20080813182235.015|20080813182236.696|CCO|no evidence. 
20080813182236.696|20080813182238.376|CCO|But it is something police are looking

20080813183612.692|20080813183614.669|CCO|is a blogger, Aster Btas (ph): "At 
20080813183614.669|20080813183616.646|CCO|4:30  a.m., we were woken up by

20080813183634.442|20080813183636.419|CCO|an incredibly huge rally in 
20080813183636.419|20080813183638.396|CCO|the center of Tbilsi and people crying during Saakashvili's address. Second,

20080813183640.374|20080813183642.351|CCO|politicians were talking. Yet

20080813183646.305|20080813183648.283|CCO|And Brianna, as we start to take a look at these, there aren't that many -- and there aren't that many that have

20080813183652.237|20080813183654.214|CCO|But we're looking at them more and more, and we're finding that we usually get them one or two days after

20080813183819.418|20080813183821.401|CCO|agreed to pay an FAA

20080813183823.384|20080813183825.367|CCO| But -- and I  remember this case, I  was actually flying the same day it happened, and it was spreading throughout the airport, hey -- this 
20080813183825.367|20080813183827.350|CCO|happened. 
20080813183827.350|20080813183829.333|CCO|Word travels fast. 
20080813183829.333|20080813183831.316|CCO|OK.  So 
20080813183831.316|20080813183833.299|CCO|apparently she paid the $3,000  
20080813183833.299|20080813183835.282|CCO|fine and said they just wanted 
20080813183835.282|20080813183837.265|CCO|it to go away. 
20080813183837.265|20080813183839.248|CCO|They paid that to the FAA. 
20080813183839.248|20080813183841.231|CCO| But does that necessarily mean that Victoria

20080813183847.179|20080813183849.162|CCO|She paid a fine -- an administrative fine for

20080813183901.060|20080813183903.043|CCO|That's what has to be proven here. So by paying the fine and hoping it

20080813184639.321|20080813184640.942|CCO|barriers, because of a lack of insurance. But 
20080813184640.942|20080813184642.563|CCO|what they found is that three out of four

20080813184706.876|20080813184708.497|CCO|And sure that was an issue, but for as many people the issue was that

20080813184710.118|20080813184711.739|CCO|or they sought out folk medicine or spiritual healers,

20080813184716.602|20080813184718.222|CCO|>> COHEN: This actually gets us to another reason why they weren't seeing a doctor regularly. Hispanics, in 
20080813184718.222|20080813184719.843|CCO|general, on average 
20080813184719.843|20080813184721.464|CCO|tend to be younger than other 
20080813184721.464|20080813184723.085|CCO|Americans on the whole. 
20080813184723.085|20080813184724.706|CCO|The median age of Hispanics in the United States is age 
20080813184724.706|20080813184726.327|CCO|28-years-old. The 
20080813184726.327|20080813184727.948|CCO|rest of the population, the median 
20080813184727.948|20080813184729.569|CCO|age is 37. 
20080813184729.569|20080813184731.189|CCO| So that probably is another reason -- when 
20080813184731.189|20080813184732.810|CCO|you're young, you're healthy, you 
20080813184732.810|20080813184734.431|CCO|think you don't really need a doctor.

20080813184740.915|20080813184742.536|CCO|maybe they are young and healthy now, but they're 
20080813184742.536|20080813184744.156|CCO|also not getting the preventative care

20080813184745.777|20080813184747.398|CCO|And so the concern is that maybe now this

20080813185650.733|20080813185652.623|CCO|And you can see up -- if we can see, actually we're focused 
20080813185652.623|20080813185654.512|CCO|on the second rescue here, 
20080813185654.512|20080813185656.401|CCO|the man suspended by a safety

20080813185717.184|20080813185719.074|CCO|It appears he is standing on something. 
20080813185720.963|20080813185722.852|CCO|Maybe it is this fire department

20080813185855.430|20080813185857.320|CCO|at this point, they appear to be in 
20080813185857.320|20080813185859.209|CCO|a holding pattern until they can 
20080813185859.209|20080813185901.098|CCO|figure out maybe how to loosen this 
20080813185901.098|20080813185902.988|CCO|restraint on this guy here on the 
20080813185902.988|20080813185904.877|CCO|14th floor. 
20080813185904.877|20080813185954.000|NER_01|Person=Don Lemon|Role=CNN ANCHOR
20080813185904.877|20080813185906.766|CCO|>> LEMON: You can imagine they've been there 
20080813185906.766|20080813185908.656|CCO|for a while. 
20080813185908.656|20080813185910.545|CCO|Because it takes a while to get a fire truck there and to get these teams there to lower the stuff 
20080813185910.545|20080813185912.434|CCO|from the roof and also, to get a ladder 
20080813185912.434|20080813185914.324|CCO|up this high, up to the 12th, 
20080813185914.324|20080813185916.213|CCO|13th, 14th floor. 
20080813185916.213|20080813185918.102|CCO|It takes a while to do that. 
20080813185918.102|20080813185919.992|CCO|So these guys were just sort of suspended there for a while, waiting for the fire department and waiting 
20080813185919.992|20080813185921.881|CCO|for someone to come 
20080813185921.881|20080813185923.770|CCO|and rescue them. 
20080813185923.770|20080813185925.660|CCO|The gentleman up at the top as we have been telling you, has been 
20080813185925.660|20080813185927.549|CCO|rescued. 
20080813185927.549|20080813185929.439|CCO|But he was dangling there on what thought in the beginning when we were looking at these pictures, was scaffolding. 
20080813185931.328|20080813185933.217|CCO|But as it turns out, it was the window 
20080813185933.217|20080813185935.107|CCO|washing platform. 
20080813185935.107|20080813185936.996|CCO|And then this was where they had strapped 
20080813185936.996|20080813185938.885|CCO|that platform to the roof, as is 
20080813185938.885|20080813185940.775|CCO|done daily all over the world. 
20080813185940.775|20080813185942.664|CCO|But something obviously went wrong here. 
20080813185944.553|20080813185946.443|CCO|But again, as Brianna said, the safety harness, everything 
20080813185946.443|20080813185948.332|CCO|appeared to work in this 
20080813185948.332|20080813185950.221|CCO|case because 
20080813185950.221|20080813185952.111|CCO|we don't have any reports 
20080813185952.111|20080813185954.000|CCO|of any other people on that 
20080813185954.000|20080813195956.000|CCO|platform being injured except for these two men that we see now. And we don't know if they've been injured or the extent of anything, if there are any injuries at all. 
20080813185954.000|20080813185954.000|NER_01|Person=Brianna Keilar|Role=CNN ANCHOR
20080813185954.000|20080813195956.000|CCO|>> KEILAR: You can see the other line that's being brought down here to the right of this man. The blue line obviously, his safety harness. The right line, I  don't know if that is some sort of rope that has been tossed down by the crews that we see working on top of this hotel. But, they've stabilized him on top of this fire department ladder. But obviously, he's still in a very precarious position. So, they're trying to obviously get him freed from his harness. But again, this is happening on North Ocean Boulevard in Fort Lauderdale. Fort Lauderdale fire and rescue trying to rescue -- they rescued one window washer, they're trying to rescue another after this window washing platform collapsed. And this is at a hotel. So these two men just there, doing their job on a day in Fort Lauderdale, when really, a situation that's not supposed to happen, happen. This window washing platform collapses.

20080813185954.000|20080813195956.000|CCO|>> LEMON: And you can imagine, this guy is probably saying, you know what? I'm happy that they're here rescuing me, but, boy, I  wish this harness would just somehow be off of me now, so that I  can get inside of that window and get back to life as normal. And anyone who has been in any sort of situation where you have been in an accident, you know the adrenaline is pumping and flowing. And you don't know how you feel really until you're out of that situation. And they're going to check both of these guys out and see exactly what injuries they might have sustained after this, because the scaffolding was up a couple of floors. What do you say, Brianna, four or five floors above where this guy is? The scaffolding was pretty high. So, he had quite a drop there when he fell from that scaffolding which gave way. 
20080813185954.000|20080813185954.000|NER_01|Person=Brianna Keilar|Role=CNN ANCHOR
20080813185954.000|20080813195956.000|CCO|>> KEILAR: It looks like it was maybe up five or six floors. Then when the scaffolding fell from horizontal to vertical, one of the -- the second window-washer caught actually on the scaffolding or on the platform. He was able to hold on to that. So he probably fell maybe a floor or two. But, yes, this, the gentleman there on the bottom, this is the crew working on the roof. And actually it kind of looks like they're getting -- what are they doing here?

20080813185954.000|20080813195956.000|CCO|>> LEMON: I  don't know if they're going to cut. He's stuck up here. And they may be trying to get some slack to that so they can actually get him down on that ladder, because it appears to be that he's stuck in that position.
