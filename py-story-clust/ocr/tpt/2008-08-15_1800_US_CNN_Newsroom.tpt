20080815180342.526|20080815180344.803|CCO|of course, a very important 
20080815180344.803|20080815180347.081|CCO|factor in all this is, 
20080815180347.081|20080815180349.358|CCO|which is the question, when will 
20080815180349.358|20080815180351.635|CCO|the Russian forces pull out of Georgia, 
20080815180351.635|20080815180353.912|CCO|if in fact that is what they have 
20080815180353.912|20080815180356.189|CCO|intend to do? 
20080815180356.189|20080815180358.466|CCO|Now, if you look at the city of Gori, that, of course, a 
20080815180358.466|20080815180400.743|CCO|strategically important city. 
20080815180400.743|20080815180403.020|CCO|And the reports that we're hearing from there is that Russian forces are still 
20080815180403.020|20080815180405.297|CCO|firmly in control of that town. They're not in the city center, but they 
20080815180405.297|20080815180407.574|CCO|are on the outskirts of town. They 
20080815180407.574|20080815180409.851|CCO|control all of the roads 
20080815180409.851|20080815180412.128|CCO|leading into that town. 
20080815180412.128|20080815180414.405|CCO|Further west, near the province of 
20080815180414.405|20080815180416.682|CCO|Abkhazia, that other breakaway province, there is a substantial 
20080815180416.682|20080815180418.959|CCO|number of Russian forces 
20080815180418.959|20080815180421.236|CCO|in the town of Senaki, holding

20080815180428.067|20080815180430.344|CCO|Now, we've heard from Condoleezza Rice. 
20080815180430.344|20080815180432.621|CCO|She was saying Russians must pull 
20080815180432.621|20080815180434.898|CCO|out their forces out of Georgia immediately.

20080815180504.499|20080815180506.777|CCO|What they are -- what she is saying 
20080815180506.777|20080815180509.054|CCO|is that she believes that 
20080815180509.054|20080815180511.331|CCO|the Russians will sign this agreement. 
20080815180513.608|20080815180515.885|CCO|Now, the plan was worked out and it

20080815185229.285|20080815185230.980|CCO|the end. 
20080815185230.980|20080815185232.674|CCO|Start by getting a home energy audit. 
20080815185232.674|20080815185234.369|CCO|The Department of Energy's web site. That shows you, you can do it yourself.

20080815185237.759|20080815185239.454|CCO|The audit really pinpoints where your home 
20080815185239.454|20080815185241.149|CCO|is losing energy and evaluates the

20080815185244.538|20080815185246.233|CCO|And believe it or not, older furnaces are only 60  percent efficient. Which means you're losing about 40  percent of the heat, but you're still paying for it. Modern heating systems on the other hand -- they can be about 97

20080815185330.298|20080815185331.993|CCO|are pre-cut jackets or blankets. They cost about $20
