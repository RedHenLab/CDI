20080815130050.470|20080815130052.049|CCO|here. We're 
20080815130052.049|20080815130053.628|CCO|talking about a fire that is 
20080815130053.628|20080815130055.207|CCO|happening in San Francisco. 
20080815130055.207|20080815130056.786|CCO|You see the pictures there now.

20080815130059.944|20080815130101.523|CCO|California. 
20080815130101.523|20080815130103.102|CCO|This is apparently -- unfortunately, a retirement 
20080815130103.102|20080815130104.681|CCO|community. 
20080815130104.681|20080815130106.260|CCO|It was built -- this building -- back in the 1930s, so, obviously, very, very 
20080815130106.260|20080815130107.839|CCO|old. 
20080815130107.839|20080815130109.418|CCO|The building has been evacuated. 
20080815130109.418|20080815130110.997|CCO|But, of course, that is a very difficult 
20080815130110.997|20080815130112.576|CCO|procedure given the age 
20080815130112.576|20080815130114.155|CCO|of the residents. 
20080815130114.155|20080815130115.734|CCO|People were transported from 
20080815130115.734|20080815130117.313|CCO|the scene. We're now looking at live 
20080815130117.313|20080815130118.892|CCO|pictures. Obviously, those flames 
20080815130118.892|20080815130120.471|CCO|have been extinguished. 
20080815130120.471|20080815130122.050|CCO|So that is a very good thing. 
20080815130122.050|20080815130123.629|CCO|All we know at this point is one 
20080815130123.629|20080815130125.208|CCO|injury that is -- major and two minor 
20080815130125.208|20080815130126.787|CCO|injuries. Apparently, this fire 
20080815130126.787|20080815130128.366|CCO|started at 3:00  a.m. local time.

20080815130148.127|20080815130149.610|CCO|>> REYNOLDS WOLF, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Hey, Heidi. You're right, we're watching this 
20080815130149.610|20080815130151.094|CCO|area of disturbed weather that is moving 
20080815130151.094|20080815130152.577|CCO|right over parts of Puerto Rico. 
20080815130152.577|20080815130154.060|CCO|San Juan has been hit especially 
20080815130154.060|20080815130155.544|CCO|hard this morning with 
20080815130155.544|20080815130157.027|CCO|some heavy rainfall, some strong winds, 
20080815130157.027|20080815130158.510|CCO|and some strong surf. 
20080815130158.510|20080815130159.994|CCO|We're also seeing that beginning 
20080815130159.994|20080815130201.477|CCO|to move into parts of the Dominican 
20080815130201.477|20080815130202.960|CCO|Republic. 
20080815130202.960|20080815130204.444|CCO|One thing we're watching, though, is if the 
20080815130204.444|20080815130205.927|CCO|center of circulation remains 
20080815130205.927|20080815130207.410|CCO|over this warm ocean water, 
20080815130207.410|20080815130208.894|CCO|there's a very good chance the 
20080815130208.894|20080815130210.377|CCO|storm could strengthen and become something 
20080815130210.377|20080815130211.860|CCO|else, possibly a named store as we get into the weekend. I 
20080815130211.860|20080815130213.344|CCO| want you to notice this. This is 
20080815130213.344|20080815130214.827|CCO|what we referred to as our spaghetti 
20080815130214.827|20080815130216.310|CCO|models. 
20080815130216.310|20080815130217.794|CCO|Now you'll notice this big pink line takes it right into 
20080815130217.794|20080815130219.277|CCO|the Caribbean. 
20080815130219.277|20080815130220.760|CCO|That is not one of the models. 
20080815130220.760|20080815130222.244|CCO|That is actually the path of extrapolation 
20080815130222.244|20080815130223.727|CCO|and if it were to continue 
20080815130223.727|20080815130225.210|CCO|on the present course, it 
20080815130225.210|20080815130226.694|CCO|would move right into the Caribbean. 
20080815130228.177|20080815130229.660|CCO|The thing is, it's not expected to 
20080815130229.660|20080815130231.144|CCO|move that way. 
20080815130231.144|20080815130232.627|CCO|It's expected to actually veer a little bit 
20080815130232.627|20080815130234.110|CCO|more to the north and then to 
20080815130234.110|20080815130235.594|CCO|the northwest and there's a possibility 
20080815130235.594|20080815130237.077|CCO|that remains over land. 
20080815130238.560|20080815130240.044|CCO|It could weaken considerably if it 
20080815130240.044|20080815130241.527|CCO|hugs the shoreline right near

20080815130243.010|20080815130244.494|CCO|Haiti. 
20080815130244.494|20080815130245.977|CCO|Well, there's a chance it could continue 
20080815130245.977|20080815130247.460|CCO|to strengthen. 
20080815130247.460|20080815130248.944|CCO|Just near this area, separating Haiti and the Dominican Republic, you've got 
20080815130248.944|20080815130250.427|CCO|really high elevation. 
20080815130250.427|20080815130251.910|CCO|So I  would say, without a doubt, you're 
20080815130251.910|20080815130253.394|CCO|going to have some heavy rainfall 
20080815130253.394|20080815130254.877|CCO|possible, possible mud slides and 
20080815130254.877|20080815130256.360|CCO|some flooding there. 
20080815130256.360|20080815130257.844|CCO|But then if that storm takes a turn a 
20080815130257.844|20080815130259.327|CCO|little bit to the north near Ragged Island into the 
20080815130259.327|20080815130300.810|CCO|Bahamas, there is a real danger, 
20080815130300.810|20080815130302.294|CCO|real potential for this storm 
20080815130302.294|20080815130303.777|CCO|strengthening. 
20080815130303.777|20080815130305.260|CCO|Some of the models, you'll notice, bringing 
20080815130305.260|20080815130306.744|CCO|in the South Florida, 
20080815130306.744|20080815130308.227|CCO|right near into parts of I-95,  
20080815130308.227|20080815130309.710|CCO|into the Keys possibly. There's 
20080815130309.710|20080815130311.194|CCO|even a chance the storm could 
20080815130311.194|20080815130312.677|CCO|move back into the Gulf of Mexico or right 
20080815130312.677|20080815130314.160|CCO|along the eastern sea board. 
20080815130315.644|20080815130317.127|CCO|One thing I  want you to remember. Remember a 
20080815130317.127|20080815130318.610|CCO|little bit of history, 
20080815130318.610|20080815130320.094|CCO|back in 2004,  you had Hurricane 
20080815130320.094|20080815130321.577|CCO|Charlie that had a bead 
20080815130321.577|20080815130323.060|CCO|right into parts of Tampa. 
20080815130323.060|20080815130324.544|CCO|But you'll remember, at the last minute, made that quick right-hand 
20080815130324.544|20080815130326.027|CCO|turn into Punta Gorda. The 
20080815130326.027|20080815130327.510|CCO|reason why I  bring this up is to 
20080815130327.510|20080815130328.994|CCO|let you know these storms, again, 
20080815130328.994|20080815130330.477|CCO|can really vary in terms of 
20080815130330.477|20080815130331.960|CCO|their strength, their speed, their

20080815130333.444|20080815130334.927|CCO|So certainly something to watch very 
20080815130334.927|20080815130336.410|CCO|carefully and certainly it's time 
20080815130336.410|20080815130337.894|CCO|to be prepared, Heidi. It
