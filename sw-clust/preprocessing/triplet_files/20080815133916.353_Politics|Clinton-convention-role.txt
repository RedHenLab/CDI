she | ran | the fact 
she | was | the first woman 
the democrats | will handle | the details

She | got | eight votes 
Clinton | could expect | a lot 
she | could politely decline | the support 
everyone | to get | Obama 
Larry Sabato | is | the University of Virginia 
She | can make | VIRGINIA 
all | letting | the peoples 
She | benefits | the process 
Senator Hillary Clinton | has made | history 
She | benefits | Obama
