Hamas | took | control of Gaza 
Palestinian fighters | have fired | more than rockets 
Israel | entered | a truce 
this group | is | stake 
Masks | hide | its new recruits identity 
these men | do marching | drills 
target practice | learn to overcome | any obstacles 
the tactics | feared | Israel 
The PRC | was | one of the groups 
This kind of training | can only take | place 
the Israeli forces | ca nt see | This kind of training 
they | burn | tires 
Only one man | shows | his face 
Ibrahim Dahman | is already wanted | Israel 
He | tells | me 
they | re preparing | an Israeli incursion 
We | have been | siege 
We | are blindfolded and driven | the back of a van 
the canister | convinces | the rocket makers 
a fear | voiced | many Israeli officials 
the factions | agreed | a truce 
Israel | to respect | a truce 
The PRC | supports | Hamas 
one spokesman | said | last week 
nothing | improves | three weeks 
Popular Resistance Committees | would return | the cycle of violence 
Thousands of rockets | have been fired | Israel 
Materials | used | the rockets 
They | want | the world 
They | want | Israel 
these men | still building | rockets 
they | do nt want to give | these men location 
PRC spokesman Mohammad Abdel Al | looks | a new rocket 
Nasser | has | double the range of Nasser 
a demonstration | choreographed | the camera 
a rare glimpse | happens | the scenes of a truce 
we | have | some breaking news 
we | re going to hold | on that 
Just | want to finish | that last story 
We | did give | the Israeli government 
a chance | to respond | Paulas report 
what Israeli leaders | fear | what Israeli people 
militants | are biding | Palestinian militants time 
Hamas | is using | this period 
a longer range | can go deeper | Israel 
a more powerful warhead | can kill | more innocent civilians 
Israel south | suffered | the barrages of the rocket 
Everyone | would want | this cease fire 
these extremist elements | run | the Gaza strip 
Hamas | would be held | anything
