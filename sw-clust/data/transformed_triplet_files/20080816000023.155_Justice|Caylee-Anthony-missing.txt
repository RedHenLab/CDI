the child | was buried | the back yard 
we | bailed | the lady 
They | ` d killed | the child

Nancy Grace parents | to | her brother 
she | was living with | little Caylee 
Casey Anthony | set to walk | free 72 hours 
we | learn | reports 
cell phone triangulation records | point | a remote and isolated area 
she | was | that area 
documents | showed | she 
she | would have been | that area 
We | won | t 
we | ` re showing | the viewers 
we | are seeing | a very heavily-wooded area 
she | might have been doing | that area 
There ` s no easy explanation as to what she might have been doing in that area | ` | s 
we | have | any idea 
the cell records | place | Kathi Belich with WFTV there 
t | reported | cell records 
it hasn ` t | was | the daytime 
she | got | information 
everyone | know | Nikki Pierce with WDBO also joining us 
really no way | to prove | the amount of time 
Casey | had spent | that area 
she | could have been picking | someone 
we | know | she 
they | get | a signal 
she | could probably get | a signal 
a cell tower | be connected | the cell tower 
she | walked | the woods 
the cell phone company | pings | your phone 
re | update | your location 
we | could easily determine how | she 
the woods | finding | the records 
the phone | stopped responding | pings 
she | was | that densely-populated area 
a canopy of trees | would not let | a signal 
we | can help find | Caylee 
we | can help find | little Caylee 
That ` | s | the grandfather 
your heart | starts | beating 
Everybody | has | positive thoughts 
We | are taking | your calls 
My question | crosses | my mind

a lot | covering | a lot of people 
Leonard Padilla | gets | Lillian

she | gets | a hot shower 
s | not going to happen | all 
the focus | finding | Caylee 
Casey | lied | the day 
the cell phone records | are helping | investigators 
the man | plans to get | about the day 
We | are taking | your calls

Don | have | Keisar -LRB- ph -RRB- 
a woman | was leading | her away 
Casey | has misplaced | Caylee 
she | ` | s 
drugs | think | she 
she | passed | Nancy Grace 
she | could spend | more time 
the date detectives | feel | the toddler 
the last time | saw | Caylee 
the last time you saw Caylee | was | June 15th 
she | told | me 
that time | have not seen | my daughter 
We | know | she 
we | know | the date 
my gut | feels | she 
addition | learning | mom Casey 
we | learned | triangulation 
Triangulation | was | the method 
We | learned | today 
closed doors grandmother Cindy Anthony | meets | police 
s | unleash | the lawyers 
s | go | the lines 
this and | would do | anything 
myself | had | the twins 
s | behavior | even more incomprehensible 
anything | to protect | my child 
they | are being pilloried | the press 
they | are reacting | a place of love 
they | love | s grandparents ` house daughter 
she | ` s telling | s grandparents ` house 
many of us | see | the press 
we | know | of 
she | is currently charged | child neglect 
additional elements | to prove | murder 
she | could face | murder charges 
the same argument | s | the set of circumstances 
the death | was also | the same argument 
they | don | ` t 
we | have | child endangerment 
t | think | any prudent prosecutor 
they | know | a possible homicide 
the state | can go forward | the child neglect claim 
they | can go forward | a murder charge 
they | made | a mistake 
she | has | Sixth Amendment 
re | saying | me 
we | have | false statements 
they | go forward | child neglect charges 
Jose Baez | files | a speedy trial demand 
They | ` | ve 
he | files | speedy trial demand 
they | go forward | child neglect 
later she | could face | a murder charge 
she | could face | a murder charge 
t | think | the elements of child neglect 
she | could face | murder charges 
She | could face | murder charges 
re | saying | no 
the neglect | led | the death of the child 
s | based | the same circumstances 
she | can ` | t. GRACE 
the neglect charge | points | the neglect 
That ` | s | the neglect 
A murder charge | would require | completely different elements 
this child | s | body 
different elements | to be proven | a court of law 
just neglect | tending | the child 
the neglect | led | the murder 
the whole neglect charges | would be | a lie 
a babysitter | was | no evidence 
So your client | is | a whole heap of trouble 
they | could both go forward | a homicide charge 
a homicide charge | be | murder 
case | is now filed | they 
we | proved | viewers 
lawyers | argue | all of the time 
` t | understand | two things 
t | understand why | she 
` t | understand | number one 
she | ` ll flee | she 
jail | don | ` t think 
t | understand why | the parents 
she | tells | her parents 
She | has | a right 
a judge | to set | a bond 
s | got | a right 
The judge | set | a fairly high bond of $ 500,000 
the bounty hunter | is going to bail | Nancy Grace 
` t | have to put | $ 500 thou 
my nephew | will put up | a bond 
He | has | a line of credit 
she | was to fail to appear | he 
which | to bring | Nancy Grace back 
he | would lose | $ 500 thou 
` t | have to put | just 10 percent 
s | got to put | a bond 
federal civil rights violations | could be invoked | the federal government 
s | tried | the local charges 
she | is | a protected class 
this juncture | is not deemed | a protected class 
the federal government | would get away | the federal government if she 
Penny Douglass Furr | ` | s

they | can determine where | the right soil 
any specific trace elements | are | that area 
what factors | will determine how well | remains 
they | live there | s 
this cell phone triangulation | be | an easy matter 
dogs | to locate | remains 
the water | s definitely going to inhibit | a lot of the detection 
re | going to have to set | a perimeter 
They | ` re going to have to do | a grid search 
they | ` re going to have to go | parcel 
Now the cell phone records | are indicating | she 
they | ` re going to want | to

Not only | were | those gray slacks
