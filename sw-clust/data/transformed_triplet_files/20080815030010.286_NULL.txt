Secretary of State Rice | is | Paris 
Defense Secretary Gates today | sounding | a clear warning 
he | said | quote 
The U.S.-Russia relationship | could be adversely affected | years 
He | ruled | any American use of force 
The United States | spent | 45 years 
no reason | to change | that approach 
the president | told | about a third of the country 
the situation | is | the ground 
we | do have | a fairly good idea 
the Russians | attacked | two fronts 
they | went | both 
they | secured | those areas 
They | pushed | undisputed Georgian territory 
they | seized | one 
the thing | struck | me 
most | was | just how comfortable 
The Georgian troops | 've seen have rallied | the original onslaught 
they | pose | no real threat 
they | most | the second front to the west 
we | heard | a column of about 100 Russian armored vehicles 
The Russians | are | the box seat 
Russia | looks | they 
Russian officials | said | today

the Defense Secretary | ruling | the use of force 
We | 'll have | more 
we | heard | the top of the program

Russia | to show | some remorse

he | called | its aggressive posture and actions 
the U.S.-Russian relationship | could be adversely affected | years 
he | got | a briefing 
The president | called | Russia 
Georgia's territorial integrity | to honor | the cease-fire agreement 
Russia | would face | consequences 
She | said | the consequences 
she | conceded | perhaps Russia's leaders 
Condoleezza Rice | was | Paris 
she | hoping to get | all this 
the head of the European Union | negotiated | a cease-fire agreement 
that Secretary Rice | is bringing | Georgia 
the President of Georgia | can sign | Georgia

just | to see where | the money
