Critics | accused | McCain campaign 
biblical prophesy | to stir | evangelical voters

the classic republican play book | playing | these peoples 
He | could be | a cosmic antichrist figure 
a significant part of the American community | will take | this stuff 
Democratic faith issues | argues | Eric Sapp 
the McCain ad | borrows | ideas 
the block buster | left | series 
The books | weave | a tale of a modern day anti-Christ 
a young political leader | rises | power 
a message of peace and unity | leads | a world religion 
this Obama clip | used | the ad
