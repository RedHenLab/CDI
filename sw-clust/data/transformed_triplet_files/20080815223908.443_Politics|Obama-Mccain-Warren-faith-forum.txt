CNN | will carry | CNN 
either one of these candidates | hit | home 
Barack Obama | is making quite | a bit of headway 
he | 's doing | Evangelicals 
John McCain | is somewhat AWOL | AWOL 
his faith | talking | faith-related issues 
John McCain | is why | come Saturday night 
he | does n't want to do | Saturday night 
he | 's going to do | Saturday night 
he | 's just shown | no indication 
he | wants to talk | faith 
He | has | a few powerful stories 
he | does n't like talking | no indication 
all the Evangelicals | talk to say | we 
he | believes | INAUDIBLE -RRB- 
a lot of Americans | feel | yes faith 
a third of the voters | voted | President Bush 
2004 | were | white Christian Evangelicals 
they | delivered | states 
the ballot | drove | those kinds of values voters 
Barack Obama | talks | his faith 
tomorrow 's Faith | does | a couple of things 
one thing | reinforces | the point 
he | 's | a Muslim 
one thing | reassures | some of these voters 
one thing | would n't be | he 
one thing | will make | one thing 
Republicans | to get | that vote 
he | 's | a Muslim 
no matter | how | many times 
this thing | has | the potential 
The reason I say that is when you talk about something as personal as your faith | shows | a nanosecond 
Hillary Clinton | was | both 
The reason I say that is when you talk about something as personal as your faith | watched | the whole thing 
John McCain | try to talk | this stuff 
a kid | try to play | the violin 
John McCain | watching | a little 
Jack | has hit | the nail right 
a lot of times | 'll talk | the McCain campaign 
they | 'll say | he 
they | 'll go | the checklist 
Evangelical | to throw | Evangelicals 
he | 's not doing | any of Evangelical 
he | gets | the chair 
one of the things | was suggested | some months 
a bone | giving | hints 
he | would do | terms 
he | would run | administration 
he | did n't talk | religion 
FOREMAN : Susan , | had | any effect 
people | want | kind of look 
a lot of voters | do n't really go | a litany of issues 
They | do n't have | a single issue 
They | want to see | a president 
they | want | a president 
they | can trust | they 
FOREMAN | is | this group of voters 
that John McCain | has | a deep faith 
he | has | a history 
we | 've seen | presidential candidates 
the last decade | so learn | they 
we | have | anymore time 
That Faith Forum | airs | tomorrow
