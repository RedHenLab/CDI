they | are developing | an enormous budget surplus

American taxpayers | are paying | $ 130 
' dollars | to reconstruct | Iraq 
we | 're spending | money 
Those hotels | will be owned | the Iraqi government 
the way | to end | the Iraqi government 
We | should n't need to have to pass | that law 
The president | should call up | Maliki 
the administration | promised | the reconstruction of Iraq 
Iraq | has not been | the case 
We | have spent | seven times 
they | do n't have | the bureaucracy 
the president | can end | seven 
They | are sitting | some $ 80 billion 
they | could be spending | Iraq 
we | need to put | a limitation 
Iraq | using | American taxpayer funds

the Congress | appropriates | money 
a lot of people | want | the Iraqis 
the U.S. | has already spent | Iraq 
the deputy White House press secretary | said | the other day 
we | will have | a long-term ally 
the Iraqis | reimburse | American taxpayers 
the Defense Authorization Bill | hope | we 
we | need to be | we 
Iraq | to succeed | a self-governing , self-defending democracy 
Iraq | looks well | its way 
we | would n't even be having | this discussion 
we | have fought to help | Democratic leaders in the United States Senate 
the first Arab country | to become | Democratic leaders in the United States Senate 
The only person in all of the United States | is why | we 
we | 've expended | so much blood and treasure 
we | can take | something 
they | should n't be giving | the U.S. 
We | should n't be taking | something 
they | should n't get | value for 
We | tried to get | the Defense Authorization Bill 
the motion | to proceed | which 
enough Republican votes | to bring | a defense bill 
the floor of the United States Senate | was | the 82nd or so Republican filibuster 
' money | to build | hotels 
We | can decide legislatively | which 
we | 're going to do | Iraq 
we | can get | the Republican filibuster 
the president | can simply call | his buddy 
The American taxpayers | are offended | the idea 
the same time | using | taxpayers 
' money | to build | Iraqi hotels 
a lot of Americans | feel | the Iraqis 
Iraq | can govern and defend | itself 
we | had simply quit | Harry Reid 
we | would n't even be having | this discussion 
Iraqis | need to bear | more financial responsibility

Iraqi oil surpluses | to do | the charge 
we | had had | our way 
we | would have had | a reasonable timetable

we | 've seen | Iraq 
Prime Minister Maliki | take | the initiative 
Iraqis | leading | the fight 
the background | providing | counseling and guidance 
here | has n't been | tremendous progress 
We | 're going to leave | WOLF BLITZER 
we | 'll have | both of you
