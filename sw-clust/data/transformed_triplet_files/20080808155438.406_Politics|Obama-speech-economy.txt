the presidential candidates | are saying | part of our effort 
an informed decision | come | Election Day 
what Barack Obama | said | reporters 
we | 've been talking | the economy 
the stories | hear | the campaign trail 
single moms | ca n't afford | groceries 
folks | have lost | single moms who ca n't afford groceries jobs 
they | find | a new job 
they | 're getting | paid two-thirds of what 
they | were making before | fewer benefits 
The American people | are hurting | they 
an energy policy | can drive | gas prices 
we | are investing | roads and bridges 
the United States | can put | people 
my sense | is | the summer months
