this conflict | has | another face 
The people | forced | quite a few people gathering homes and fighting and fear 
one of the more frustrating things | trying to cover | this story 
We | do n't know how | people 
we | 'll begin to get | those numbers 
we | 're getting | the different sides 
Russia | has said | at least 2000 people 
hundreds or thousands | have been killed | Russian troops 
mind | hear | the claims 
We | 're hearing | both sides 
We | have | nothing 
We | 'll just take | a moment 
which | is just | the breakaway province of South Ossetia 
some major humanitarian groups | have | some information online 
Let's | go | the Red Cross 
today | are flying | 15 tons of medicine and medical supplies 
Let | 's go now | the U.N. refugee agency 
one actual solid figure | have | my hands 
they | 're getting | Russian officials 
North Ossetia | indicate | 30,000 people 
thousands more | may have fled south | other areas 
We | 're talking | tens of thousands 
one more Web site | bring | one 
They | have | this emergency appeal 
we | have | that right 
a story | see | some of the faces
