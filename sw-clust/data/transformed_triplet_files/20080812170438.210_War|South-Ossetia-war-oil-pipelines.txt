Georgia | does n't produce | much oil 
Georgia | crosses | Georgia's territory 
oil markets | panicking | this war 
CNN's Ali Velshi | is tracking | the trading 
He | is | New York 
we | 're not having much | a reaction 
the price of oil to what 's going on | may be | the price of oil to what 's going on 
which | can see | the green , 
that oil | goes | Bakku 
that oil | goes | four pipelines 
The red line | goes | a Georgian port 
the green line | goes down | Turkey 
that oil | goes | the Middle East 
the consortium of western countries | run | three of those pipelines 
Two of them | were shut | this morning 
this big green which | goes | Azerbaijan 
Kurdish rebels | had attacked | pipeline 
most of the oil | goes | Georgia 
BP | has said | none of the pipelines 
BP | manages | that part of the world 
which | happened | last week 
they | are shutting | the pipelines 
They | are | the other 
the way | would be | a problem 
damage to these pipelines , which by the way , are mostly underground | would affect | our consumption of oil 
the world | produces | about 87 million barrels of oil 
we | use | about 85 million barrels of oil 
two million | is just | a million barrels of oil 
two million | becomes | a big deal 
We | 'll keep | a close eye
