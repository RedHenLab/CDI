Tomorrow's commute | is going to be | a mess 
these unbelievable pictures of what | happened | there earlier today 
a tractor-trailer | plunged | off Chesapeake Bay Bridge 
my wife | may be | bridges 
Two others | were seriously injured | the three-vehicle accident 
one lane | has finally been reopened | the bridge 
We | 've been talking | folks 
Authorities | do n't expect | the other part of the bridge 
we | can hook | with one of the witnesses 
we | 'll bring | police
