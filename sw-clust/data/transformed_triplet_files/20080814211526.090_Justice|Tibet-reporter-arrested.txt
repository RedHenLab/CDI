China | has spared | no expense 
Beijing | promised | the media 
complete freedom | to report | China 
he | tried to cover | a protest 
China | promised to welcome | the world 
China | slammed | the door 
A day | began | a brief moment of protest 
a commitment | made | Beijing 
no one | has told | the police 
activists | chained | themselves 
The authorities | are | a fury 
ph | proclaim | the cause of Tibet 
We | 're | we 
we | will continue | we 
the moment | encountered | the Chinese response 
they | hold | me 
These people | are arresting | me 
the Chinese police | doing | -- 
they | 've taken | my shoes 
They | 've taken | my equipment 
They | 've taken | all the equipment 
they | wo n't tell | me 
A Chinese colleague | tells | A Chinese colleague 
a journalist | 're arresting | me 
We | drove | only a few yards
