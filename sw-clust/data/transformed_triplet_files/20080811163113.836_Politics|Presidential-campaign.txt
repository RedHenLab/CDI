Let's | have | a look 
Washington | are still saying | no 
No | to | independence 
One man | knows | we 
John McCain | approved | this message 
an unconscionable sum | now being spent just | political TV ads 
We | know | issue # 1 
they | keep telling | me 
these ads | are going to run | the same volume 
Barack Obama | seemed to be | ahead of this 
John McCain | was being associated | Bush and Cheney energy policies 
he | making | some headway 
he | decided to switch | his position 
He | said | the circumstances of the rising gas prices 
his position | to do | offshore drilling 
we | saw | that clip 
the excellent | to get | the way of the good 
we | know | these two candidates 
about 70 percent of Americans | think | offshore drilling 
the reason | 's been | a shift 
this $ 192 million | spent | the federal level 
right now | sounds | a lot of money 
your car today | are to try to start driving | the earth 
other themes | were seeing | earlier 
we | saw | prescription drugs 
we | saw | guns 
the right | to bear | arms 
we | start talking | home heating fuel 
people | use | both heating oil 
they | use | natural gas 
we | do n't see | prices 
people | are going to get | quite a shock
