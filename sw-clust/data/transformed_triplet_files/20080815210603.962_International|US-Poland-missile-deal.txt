Poland | would n't protect | America 
the Poland base | would only have | 10 interceptors 
not enough kill vehicles | to take | hundreds of Russian missiles 
any ballistic missiles | fired | Iran 
John Pike of GlobalSecurity.org | explains using | a telestrator 
The Iranian missiles | are going to be going | straight overhead 
The Russians | do have | a base 
here that | 's going to go right | the edge of the Russians

the U.S. | has n't presented | evidence 
these interceptors | would n't target | Russian missiles 
Iran | does n't have | the delivery systems 
Iran | could get | this capability 
Iran | is developing | long range ballistic missiles
