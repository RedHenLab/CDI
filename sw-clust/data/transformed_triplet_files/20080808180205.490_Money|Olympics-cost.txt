China | has ever hosted | the Olympics 
we | want to find | for sure 
Larry Smith | has | the Bird's Nest 
The old blind squirrel | finds | a nut 
they | did | the first night 
a series of 29 fireworks | let | a footprint pattern 
footsteps | leading | ancient Tiananmen Square 
team USA | looking really | very dapper tonight 
they | were | one of 204 countries 
he | was | the one 
He | was raised | a series of wires 
he | lit | the cauldron
