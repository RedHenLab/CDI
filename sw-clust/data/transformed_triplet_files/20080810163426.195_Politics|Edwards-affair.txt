we | 're following as well here | the United States 
Senator Barack Obama | is visiting | his grandmother 
John McCain | is n't taking | a break 
he | keeps | politicians 
he | was having | this affair 
He | was never | Barack Obama 
he | endorsed | Obama 
He | 's not been out | a surrogate 
one time | is | everyone's impression of politicians 
he | did n't win | the nomination 
your show | would be | a lot 
The fact | -- | not 
he | ran | president 
he | told | Bob Woodruff of ABC News 
he | had | this exclusive interview 
sort | explaining | everything 
my wife | have forgiven | me 
Bill Clinton | survived | he 
a family | 's just been | so much 
They | 've had | a child die 
last year | was diagnosed | incurable cancer 
they | have to worry | about 
these payments | floating around | course 
he | was n't paying | anybody 
She | got paid | the campaign 
Dallas | was kicking | some money 
they | can put | this thing 
the other point | 's still sort | a question mark 
she | does n't want | any paternity test 
Hollywood | could n't write | Hollywood 
she | does n't want | his to happen 
Hollywood | ca n't happen | a child 
He | 's | a candidate 
he | 's | an office holder
