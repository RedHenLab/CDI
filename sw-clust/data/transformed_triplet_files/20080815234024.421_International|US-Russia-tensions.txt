This administration | has obviously miscalculated | a host of fronts 
they | are beginning to gain | some traction 
they | were | this all along 
they | needed to be brought | along 
the administration | got | to 
We | had | a weak response 
September 11 | took | President Bush 
a few days | to hit | his stride 
we | have lost | its credibility 
we | have | such debt 
we | do n't have | the moral or diplomatic or economic power 
We | saw | clip 
2001 of President Bush | talking | he 
Putin's soul | thought when | we 
a president | is inexperienced | foreign policy 
guys | are going to trade talking | points 
not a moment | would never suggest | DOBBS 
he | claimed to have | American government 
the reality | is | leadership 
the reality | is | the people 
he | is going to be | a strong future leader 
-LRB- LAUGHTER -RRB- ZIMMERMAN : Better than once in a lifetime . | would have had | perhaps more power 
sort of a peculiar thing | to come | with 
George Bush | to kick | around anymore 
terms | reining | Russia 
all of the Europe | gets | its energy 
me | put | the numbers 
Europe | is | Russia 
Russia | provides | 50 percent of all the natural gas 
someone | argued | Russia 
Europe | has been | its response 
he | went | Europe 
the need | to send | more NATO troops 
we | are going to need | leadership 
they | 're not going to go away | George Bush 
Robert Zimmerman | talked | DOBBS 
leadership | does not require | the president 
president step | start telling | the world 
Europe | to take | the lead 
our | stepping away | this blustering nonsense 
we | are always | the one 
we | 're taking | the responsibility 
we | 're paying | the way 
those nations | lack | the capacity 
we | might as well understand | the capacity 
we | are wasting | billions of dollars 
Germany | providing | 40,000 troops in Germany defense 
they | have | the stomach 
Barack Obama | is going to solve | this problem 
they | do n't have | the courage 
France and Germany | will not go | DOBBS short-term interests 
they | will always look | a way 
our government | can play | a role 
Russia | wants to be | a member of the World Trade Organization 
They | have virtually | no economy 
DOBBS technology | is | the dark ages 
we | can provide | Russia 
its failure | to develop | a relationship 
Russia | invaded | Georgia 
George Bush | will be leaving | office 
DOBBS : Do you understand , clearly , that George Bush will be leaving office on January 20 and that that 's not who you 're running against , here ? | 's about living | that legacy 
both McCain and Obama | are going to have | to 
we | 're | the ones 
We | 're going to have to leave | the profit
