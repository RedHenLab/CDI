both of these candidates | obviously trying to stay | a step 
a step ahead of the other one | comes | this conflict 
time | to pass | deeds 
he | 's actually asking | some action 
He | 's very focused | John McCain 
He | mentioned | Barack Obama 
we | have | a commander-in 
neither one of these candidates | do | they 
we | have | people 
what Obama | has to say | what John McCain 
the president | 's going to carry | out policy 
we | applaud | President Bush 
we | think | we 
we | 're talking | the Europeans 
they | 're trying to frame | John McCain 
Does anyone | come | on top 
MILBANK | benefits | McCain 
the fact of the matter | is once | most Americans 
we | 're not talking | the Georgia 
Atlanta | is | the middle 
they | lose | a lot of interest
