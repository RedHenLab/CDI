We | 're going to head | the south 
soon | will that | additional pound or two 
the good news | is mainly | water weight 
The reason | point | out 
because 3,500 calories | means | a pound 
more calories | 're taking | in 
this weekend | try not | over eat 
we | got | time 
a family member | eats | food 
bacteria | to grow | food 
all | makes | a difference 
Kind of an icky thought | thinking | your food 
bacteria | gets | the point 
your food cool | to keep | your food cool 
food | may be | no good 
Something | to think | about , guys 
We | 'll do | this again next week
