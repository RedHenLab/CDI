the White House | has perpetrated | the greatest people 
Massachusetts | would hurt | Colin Powell 
one of the White House puppets | lied | the nation 
he | endorsed | Obama 
Obama | would decline | the endorsement 
Powell | would be | Obama's nominee 
Powell | would increase | my confidence 
Powell | lost | most of his credibility 
he | made | the case 
himself | be played | he 
He | lost | the rest of his credibility 
he | allowed | Bush and Company 
Powell | represents and embodies | integrity , patriotism and vision 
the very qualities Obama | has projected | his adult life 
my husband | lost | his last excuse 
He | supported | the invasion of Iraq 
the Bush administration hacks | were discredited | one 
my husband | held | out Colin Powell 
the emperor | has | no clothes 
look | yours
