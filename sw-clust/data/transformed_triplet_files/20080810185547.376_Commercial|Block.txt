We | 're not counting | the team events 
some country's always | boycotting or being banned | both 
protests | turned | tragedy 
11 Israelis | died | the hands of Palestinian terrorists 
no clearer picture of the racial tensions | blowing | the United States 
John Carlos | giving | a black power salute 
Soviet tanks | had just crushed | a revolt 
the Hungarian water polo team | took | their revenge 
the Russians | may well be | the most violent contest 
America's Jesse Owens | poked | a hole 
team member Peter O'Connor | won | a medal 
he | climbed | the top of the Olympic flag pole 
we | do n't even have | a picture of that moment
