me | start | with 
This question | going | vacation 
we | 've seen | presidents 
the past | being caught | a little off guard , something 
they | had been | vacation 
the past being | came | Hurricane Katrina 
the other hand | comes | the president 
John McCain | to talk | the situation 
Barack Obama | 's been | John McCain's advantage 
He | 's been | Georgia number of times 
he | is | the campaign trail 
Barack Obama | is | vacation 
John McCain | is going to overplay | his hand 
He | 's starting to remind | me of Al Haig 
Ronald Reagan | got | shot 
Haig | raced | the White House 
we | have | a president 
he | is | vacation 
McCain | is going to send | his own emissaries 
which | will probably only serve | further muddy whatever waters 
he | has n't overdone | right now 
John McCain | to just back | a peg or two 
That all | plays | very 
he | ca n't help | himself 
They | want to be out | front of this rather 
the president | coming out | all of a sudden John McCain 
They | do n't want | that narrative
