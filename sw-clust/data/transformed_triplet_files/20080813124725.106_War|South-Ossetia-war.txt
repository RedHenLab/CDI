Our Matthew Chance | is | the ground 
the Russian convoy | heading closer | the capital city of Georgia 
Matthew | heard | perhaps they 
they | 're perhaps trying to carve | maybe new lines of control 
Russian forces | have turned | the road 
They | are not heading | the Georgian capital 
They | have turned | a dirt track 
right now | 's | their intention 
they | may be trying to delineate | some kind of demilitarized process zone 
the territory of South Ossetia | 'm just speculating | this point 
Georgian officials | have anticipated | this and 
the Georgians | knew | they 
the Russian offices | saying | the Georgian people 
we | 've been witnessing here | the course of the past hour 
we | had | a couple of minutes 
the Russians | never intended to hold | their end of the truce 
they | are moving | Tbilisi 
they | want to control | the government of Georgia 
this stage | think | downtown Tbilisi 
we | find | Russian forces 
They | were heading | the road 
they | have turned | that road 
We | tried to ask | some of the Russian military officers 
we | 've come here | the agreement of the Georgian people 
the road towards Tbilisi | appeared | some time 
The Russian military | has since turned | that road 
Georgia's president | feels | Russia 
the Russian troops | are not staying | place 
They | may not be engaged | hostile activities 
Matthew Chance | was suggesting | the mood 
They | were waving | flags
