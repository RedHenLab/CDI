We | have | the issue of Senator McCain 
He | 's launching | a new attack ad 
ZIMMERMAN | 's been | a big week 
She | had | the best political spot 
the McCain tactic | has been | an effective one 
they | tell | the story 
they | have got to reshow | the ad 
the attacks | responding | the ads 
every time | politically you respond | an ad 
the media's | got to show | ad 
he | did | last week 
he | runs | this kind of a campaign 
he | was n't getting | any attention 
The media | was n't paying | a bit of attention 
he | was | Republican strategist Ed Rollins 
65 percent | find | Obama more likable 
20 percent | find | McCain 
John McCain | is not going to win | a grumpy old man 
John McCain | has basically got to be | a substantive person 
McCain | wants to define | himself 
a maverick | not like | Bush 
he | 's running very much | the campaign 
Bush | ran | JOHN MCCAIN 
Barack Obama | is talking | about big ideas 
the same token , McCain | has to be | he 
Obama | is going to tax | the hell 
those | are making | $ 42,000 
factual accuracy | is required | all aspects of all politicians 
the taxes Obama | is putting | the American people 
we | see | what Bush's economics record 
John McCain | is championing | ZIMMERMAN 
the point | think | which 
they | have | an obligation
