Wal-Mart | is tangled | a new controversy 
the world's largest retailer | is pressuring | its workers 
they | are being told | Wal-Mart employees employer 
Wal-Mart officials | do not see | now 
Wal-Mart | cross | a legal line 
CNN's Randi Kaye tonight | Keeping | Them Honest 
these days | is | its customers 
The theory | goes | Wal-Mart 
Obama | has supported | a pro-labor measure 
the Employee Free Choice Act | said | he 
we | should pass | the Employee Free Choice Act 
companies | to block | unionization 
Randi Kaye | could drive up | Wal-Mart's costs 
they | were summoned | meetings 
he | attended | a meeting 
a Democratic government | would be | Wal-Mart 
We | were basically told | we 
they | were | this bill 
Republican in November | would be | Wal-Mart 
Several people | were offended | we 
the Employee Free Choice Act | to explain why | Wal-Mart 
the company | is violating | election laws 
the group | has filed | a federal complaint 
he | 's heard | complaints 
Barack Obama's name | was mentioned | the meeting 
he | was | a co-sponsor of this legislation 
he | becomes | president 
the act | would help | workers bargain 
CNN | obtained | this memo 
anyone | representing | our company 
we | were telling | associates 
we | will not take | sides 
Wal-Mart | break | the law 
Federal election rules | do allow | companies 
Wal-Mart | walked right up | the line 
They | have to have crossed | an objective threshold 
they | 're just talking | legislation 
they | 're talking | the pros and cons of different candidate's positions 
We | believe | the FEC 
we | know | what Wal-Mart's relationship 
they | favor | one more 
Wal-Mart | does seem to favor | the Republicans 
now the company | is saying | its political donations 
now | can work | leaders 
We | checked | the Center 
which | tracks | political donations 
we | learned | Wal-Mart 
the Republicans | got | most of the cash 
the Republicans | got | 98 percent of the money
