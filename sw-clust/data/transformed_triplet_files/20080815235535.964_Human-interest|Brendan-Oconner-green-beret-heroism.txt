the men and women | serve | this nation 
a Special Forces medic | risked | his life 
Afghanistan | to save | the life of a fellow soldier 
Bill Tucker | has | his story 
Master Sergeant Brendan O'Connor | has served | his country 
He | comes | a long family tradition of military service 
His father | gave | his life 
We | have to act | the everyday health care provider 
O'Connor's first combat deployment | was | Afghanistan 
many | believes to be | the army's elite force 
my opportunity | to experience | combat 
That opportunity | came | June 24 
a mission | to liberate | a village 
O'Connor's team | came | attack 
Word | came | the radio 
Their Afghan interpreter | was fighting to save | two soldiers 
O'Connor | assembled | a team 
They | came | a vast field 
the body armor | has | such bulk 
the body armor | was just plowing | the dirt 
my body armor | can make | my way 
the body armor | has | its place 
that time | did n't think | that time 
my chances | making | the body armor 
O'Connor | crossed | 200 feet 
his own life | to save | his fellow soldiers 
one soldier | did not survive | his injuries 
O'Connor's bravery | helped save | the life of the other 
O'Connor | was awarded | the army's Distinguished Service Cross 
soldiers | are putting | a good fight 
me | to have accepted | this award
