the White House | postponed | its briefing 
Let | 's get | the latest 
the U.S. | has seen | earlier reports 
the ground | is still | a little 
Secretary of State Rice | to get | the phone 
She | sent | a mid-level envoy 
the U.S. | has | this whole time 
President Bush | called | the invasion unacceptable 
He | warned | Russia not 
the violence | attacking | any targets 
Russia | appears to have backed | a little 
Russia's invasion | has really damaged | its standing 
the world | could damage | relations 
the United States | can really do to get | Russia 
Russia 's invasion | wants | Russia 's invasion 
They | do n't have | a lot of leverage 
they | 're not going to get anywhere | the U.N. Security Council 
Russia | has got | veto power 
the U.N. Security Council | can stop | U.S. efforts 
the U.N. Security Council | take | any kind of action 
The U.S. | is also saying | the U.S. 
troops | to fight | Russia 
the U.S. | needs | help 
Russia | dealing | Iran 
Russia | is | whatever 
Russia | wants and telling | the U.S. 
we | 're | the powerhouse 
one expert | gave | me 
the U.S. | ca n't do much | plead 
Russia | to stop | the phone 
the Europeans | are taking | the lead 
much of this | can really lean | Russia 
Europe | depends | Russian oil and Russian gas 
the Europeans | do to cut | the Europeans who are taking the lead in much of this off 
they | have | a little leverage 
Let | hope | they 
another card | to play | other
