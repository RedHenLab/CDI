An 8-year-old boy | has survived | the encounter 
An 86-pound black bear | came | a tree standing 
EVAN PALA | pushed | my teeth 
then my dad | pulled | my dad 
he | started tackling | me 
he | was laughing | -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- 
we | 're not going to get hurt | -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- 
they | had | that trip 
The boy's father and brother | threw | sticks and stones 
the bear | to chase | a bear 
Park rangers | ended up killing | the bear
