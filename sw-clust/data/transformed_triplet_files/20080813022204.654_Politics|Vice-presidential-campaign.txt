they | 're looking | the people 
my candidate | picks | this person 
the storyline | be | we 
a way | builds | enthusiasm 
The picture of families | would create | a lot of excitement 
The challenge | is picking | someone 
they | 're | Hillary Clinton 
none of them | have | that kind of national exposure 
the embodiment of a Republican | has been offended | the Bush years 
that Chuck Hagel | is going to be | the country 
news today that Chuck Hagel is going to be out of the country for both conventions | would take | a lot of courage 
Obama's part | to go | a Republican 
the idea | seeing | a Tim Kaine 
the fact that some of , for example , Obama 's aides really like the idea of seeing a Tim Kaine with Barack Obama , the image of change together -- that 's the young governor of Virginia -- or an Evan Bayh , also young -- | looks | a new America 
Barack Obama | keep going back | people 
Barack Obama | has | enormous personal respect 
Barack Obama | likes | the guy 
Joseph Biden | stays | the running 
Obama | has | this fit 
the candidate | feels | his gut 
Mitt Romney | seems | the most logical choice 
he | is absolutely | the most logical choice 
he | brings | the table 
Romney | reminds | me 
he | 's got | great charm 
a guy | values | honor 
the guy | makes | McCain's skin crawl 
John McCain | has | some wiggle room 
he | wants to give | the nomination 
Obama | makes | the announcement 
we | 're running out | time 
McCain | has | an advantage 
his convention | starts immediately | the Democrats 
McCain | makes | his pick 
McCain | would make | his decision
