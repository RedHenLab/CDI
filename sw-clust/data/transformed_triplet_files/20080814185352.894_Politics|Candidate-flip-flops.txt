CNN | does n't have to be | a candidate's Achilles 
Flip-floppers | are | the world 
The only person | has flip-flopped | this issue 
McCain | would want | me 
The once lowly flip-flop | has been upgraded | recent years 
The flip-flop | peaked | a political weapon 
She | patented | the one-piece mold 
they | 're | they 
The voting | is already | way 
Obama | is leading | sales two 
a guy | seems to wear | flip-flops 
they | supporting | SEAN JACKSON 
they | saying | he 
these | support | your candidate
