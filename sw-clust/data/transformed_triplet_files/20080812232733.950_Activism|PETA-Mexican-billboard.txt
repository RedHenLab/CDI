today | has come | a plan 
PETA | is requesting | the Homeland Security officials 
permission | to post | billboards 
the border fence | being constructed | our border 
the billboard | would be put | the border fence 
the United States | could expose | healthy Mexicans 
PETA | claims to have | no official position 
PETA | claims | the message 
illegal aliens | crossing | the United States 
let | 's take | a look 
a project | to create | a virtual fence 
we | should make | a fence of flat panel TV sets 
Ohio | writing | the Mexican military's incursions 
the Mexican government | would be | our army 
We | know | the answer 
corporate America | are actually running | this country 
We | can only hope come | November 
we | can show | special interest groups 
My dipstick | is | Washington 
all of our dipsticks | are | Washington 
We | appreciate | hearing 
We | 'll have | more of your thoughts
