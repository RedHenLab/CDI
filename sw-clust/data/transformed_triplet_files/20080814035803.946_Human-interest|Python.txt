We | have | another spooked-out critter 
They | got to know | each other 
Iowa meteorologist Curtis Gertz | was | a state fair last 
he | was getting | a primer 
he | was getting | a primer 
the snake | slithered | the weatherman's pants 
he | was given | his own primer 
Luckily the snake | was removed | the pair of pants 
Anderson | was me live | the air 
we | could be adding | right 
We | 're just going to leave | a lot of jokes we could be adding in right here 
We | do n't do | that kind of stuff 
she | might need to replace | the prairie dog
