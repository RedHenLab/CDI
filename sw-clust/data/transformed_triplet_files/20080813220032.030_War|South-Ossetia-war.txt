Russia's foreign minister | is telling | the U.S. 
Georgia | continuing | its partnership 
President Bush today | making | Russia 
We | expect | Russia 
its commitment | to cease | all military activities 
we | expect | all Russian forces 
recent days | to withdraw | that country 
Russia's ongoing action | raised | serious questions 
The president | driving home | his concerns 
Russia | can threaten | its neighbors 
Georgia | is accusing | Russia 
Russian armored vehicles | were seen | today

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE | -LRB- | translator -RRB-

First | to | our White House correspondent

a neighbor's country | overthrow | its government 
the White House | seems to be struggling to figure | out 
Russia | doing | just that 
Russia | must keep | its word and act 
The president | declared | he 
the region | sending | humanitarian relief 
Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili | charged | the West 
they | failed to analyze | the Russians 
the administration | has been missing | action 
Mr. Bush | does n't revisit | his Russian failures 
the rout of Georgia | will stand | the embarrassing coda 
they | have | no regrets 
they | have taken | aggressive action

He | is | the capital of Tbilisi 
Russian forces | have penetrated deep | this country

Moscow and analysis of the tough , tough talk | coming | both sides 
this fighting | began | a week 
A fragile cease-fire agreement | pulled together | European envoys

The Georgian president | presumes | the worst 
they | are encroaching | the capital 
they | have blocked | the main road 
they | have basically isolated | the capital 
They | cut | the bloodline of Tbilisi 
all | looks | an all-out attempt of occupation
