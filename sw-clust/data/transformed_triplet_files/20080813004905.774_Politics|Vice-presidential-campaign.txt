CNN | has confirmed | Hagel 
he | will also skip | the political convention 
we | can scratch | his name 
my sources | tell | me 
they | want to go | a candidate 
the perceived weakness | could be | experience 
he | would consider | Joseph Biden 
the perceived weakness | could be | age 
they | 're looking | someone 
a governor of Minnesota | is | the scene 
the other dilemma | is do | they 
Barack Obama | looking seriously | Tim Kaine 
even a Mitt Romney | might qualify | he 
the candidate | is going to bring | another state 
they | get | the Oval Office 
we | heard | all this talk 
both candidates | announcing | And running mates 
the convention | is | the corner 
We | were expecting | YELLIN : Right . 
we | 're hearing | One 
they | announce too soon | the summer 
they | would get | a bump of momentum 
in the summer | would give | the press 
the person | apart whoever | the nominees 
they | wanted to not give | as much time 
this person | make | too much time to sort of pick the person apart whoever the nominees chooses 
we | 're looking at possibly | late 
both men | to announce | a running mate 
Jessica | reported | we 
A lot of people | auditioning | the job 
we | saw | four years 
John Edwards | did | a very effective job 
other politicians | lobbying | four years ago 
a lot of overt efforts | to lobby | these candidates 
The person | has done | the most 
the guy Alex | worked | the nomination battle

Romney | has done | the most 
He | 's worked hard | Virginia 
the two | 've done | the most publicly 
we | 've been hearing | a lot of buzz 
They | were together | today 
this play with conservatives | would n't play badly | all 
CASTELLANOS : You know , I think in a way it would n't play badly at all . | might be | a very solid choice 
he | disagrees | McCain 
he | meets | the one key test McCain 
the fighter pilots | want | something 
he | can trust | his life 
he | can trust | the country's life 
somebody | has to pass | that test 
Joe Lieberman | would be | one of the few candidates 
Evan Bayh | has been floated | a strong possibility 
choosing Bayh | go | Obama's entire premise 
John McCain | wants | Joe Lieberman 
he | can have | Joe Lieberman 
Democrats | feel | that way 
ROSEN : Right . | does n't matter | he 
a lot of Democrats | voted | the war 
very early | was | the war 
new information | came | we 
he | was | others 
he | has | credibility 
Mitt Romney | has been | kind of quiet 
Joe Biden | has been | these last two weeks 
the Democratic bench | is | Obama 
Jessica | had | the Democratic bench 
he | 's | perfect-looking candidate 
a way | have | a new candidate 
a candidate | looks | a little too perfect and plastic 
Bayh | would be | the best choice 
a guy | has | a real record 
He | has | a record 
he | has | a record 
Alex | wants | Obama 
some reason | seems | a good marriage 
we | 're | time
