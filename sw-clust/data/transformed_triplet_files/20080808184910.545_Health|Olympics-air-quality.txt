-LRB- COMMERCIAL BREAK -RRB- LEMON : The summer games are under way in Beijing . | 's just | excitement 
China | has | some of the worst air pollution

The dull , gray haze | hangs | the Forbidden City

a safe reading of air quality | should be | 50 micrograms of particular matter 
we | recorded | an average reading of 207 
this period | was | Monday 
a reading | taken | London 
the American cyclists | arriving | masks 
One British athlete | thinks | One

we | should leave | the last word 
the Pentagon | may be | the spectators 
pollutants | thicken | the blood 
Our Veronica de la Cruz | has been keeping | track of all 
We | keep hearing | this pollution 
he | has been blogging | his experiences 
a smell | surrounding | me 
two people | wearing | masks 
people | are intentionally suffering to give | visitors 
they | can clear | their pollution 
they | 'll shut | factories or pollutants 
a while | only have | certain cars 
we | need | new energy alternatives 
he | got back | China 
the air quality | was | one topic 
They | do n't think | once 
KAYE | makes | all the bus smog 
New York | does n't look | New York
