Barack Obama | appears to be trying to make | the most of what 
the Obama and Clinton camps | announced | an agreement 
they | looking | here 
they | could be headed | a showdown 
we | 're | this one 
Hillary supporters | are looking | catharsis 
We | do not want | any Democrat 
Clinton's name | will be placed | nomination 
Hillary delegates | will have | the opportunity 
the Clinton folks | put | a joint statement 
which | makes it seem | they 
the vote | make | the party look 
Hillary Clinton's name | is called | she 
we | hear | some kind of a roll call 
we | have | Barack Obama supporters 
the Florida and Michigan delegations | have | Barack Obama supporters booing full votes 
the superdelegates | hold fast | Obama 
Clinton | should get | 37 percent of the votes 
Clinton | will have | the chance 
the stage | to tell | all of her supporters 
me | make | all those cracks 
the glass ceiling | is | our heads 
We | made | HOLLAND 
Let | 's get | Barack Obama 
we | know how | this one 
both of them | sharing | the stage 
a meeting | going | right 
Barack Obama | to attend | the convention 
this whole thing | is beginning to smack | extortion 
Barack Obama | is starting to look | a little 
she | 's stealing | the convention right 
Jack | makes | me 
we | would have seen | this back 
they | put | the show 
one | can come | a compromise 
people | was | a closely fought battle 
the two camps | would come together much more quickly | they 
Hillary Clinton supporters | are still | the way 
we | head | the Democratic Convention 
they | want to spoil | the convention 
he | might look | a little 
the Republicans | might have been aiming | JACK CAFFERTY 
MALVEAUX : ... does he , in some ways , take away that firepower that the Republicans might have been aiming at him , saying , look at this , they ca n't even get long and there might be protests and all of that . | act | damage control 
We | 'll know | the convention 
Her name | will be placed | nomination 
She | gets | her own production team 
she | wanted | her own 
The same people | produced | The Man 
which | was | the video 
humorless supporters of hers | will now be relegated | the lunatic fringe 
anybody | has gotten | the Brinks guys 
Hillary Clinton | has talked | catharsis 
her supporters | to have | a voice 
Barack Obama | does n't want | anything 
he | rejected | very word 
He | said | catharsis and the need 
we | end up probably having | something of a love fest 
a lot of people | make | the calculation 
MALVEAUX : And , Bill , does this set Hillary Clinton up in a strong position for , perhaps , 2012 ? | 's | a very hard one 
SCHNEIDER : Well , that 's what -- you know , a lot of people make the calculation -- and it 's not a very hard one to make -- that it is in Hillary Clinton 's interests , in some sense , in her own personal career , for Barack Obama to lose . | is | Hillary Clinton's interests 
MALVEAUX | said | some Clinton people 
she | will inherit | the party 
She | will be | Ms. I 
Her people | can not say | the record 
Bill Clinton | has controlled | the Democratic Party 
Gore | did n't win | 2000 
Kerry | did n't win | 2004 
2004 | stayed | Clinton's party 
They | 'd like to keep | 2000 ... MALVEAUX
