the Democrats | wo n't be | just a convention 
a football stadium-packed gathering | to change | the course of the nation 
Barack Obama | will accept | his party's nomination 
which | starts | exactly two weeks 
We | 're taking | a look 
the Obama campaign | wants to placate | the Clinton wing of the party 
Hillary Clinton | will address | the Democratic convention 
the 88th anniversary of women | getting | the right 
We | share | one vision 
she | 's playing | good soldier 
arms | sing | Kumbaya 
Our staffs | are | communication 
The media | will be looking | conflict 
One pro- Clinton group | has filmed | a television commercial 
Senator Clinton | will run | next week 
Another pro-Clinton group | is planning | marches 
Senator Clinton's name | placed | nomination 
she | would have to sign | on 
1,600 delegates | will be | Clinton supporters 
Senator Clinton | seemed to encourage | 200 Clinton supporters is all it would take , if they really wanted to be difficult , to make a mess at the convention 
we | did | END VIDEO CLIP 
we | 're looking | catharsis 
the prospect | changing | this country 
Obama | will be delivering | his acceptance speech 
1,600 Clinton supporters | will be lost | a sea of 73,000 Obama fans 
They | would have to have | pretty good seats
