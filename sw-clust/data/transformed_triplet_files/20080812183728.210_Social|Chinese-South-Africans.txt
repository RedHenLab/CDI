the pendulum | swung | the other way 
that Chinese South Africans | felt | a lose-lose situation 
CNN's Nkepile Mabuse | has more | Johannesburg 
he | has | China 
His great grandfather | arrived | South Africa 
They | consider | South Africa 
all | applied | Chinese 
terms | could live | your life 
your life | could make | a living 
The Chinese Association of South Africa | took | the matter 
A high court | ruled | Chinese South Africans 
the country | qualify | the law 
those Chinese | were | South African citizens 
only 10,000 | can benefit | these empowerment laws 
that Chinese South Africans | did not contribute | the struggle 
democracy | did not suffer | as much 
they | did | apartheid 
the ruling | may lead | court challenges 
We | 've had | the same complaint 
they | were not liked very much | the Afrikaanas 
we | 're saying | they 
They | insist | the court challenge 
the court challenge | was | a need
