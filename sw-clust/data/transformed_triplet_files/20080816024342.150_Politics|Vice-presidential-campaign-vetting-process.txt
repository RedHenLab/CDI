We | 'll look | the best and worst choices 
Dick Cheney | was | George W. Bush's vice president 
He | 's doing | a really good job 
he | was heading | the search effort 
Dick Cheney's selection | was | a surprise 
charge | vetting | Geraldine Ferraro 
the pressure | was having to look | Gerry Ferraro 
The preceding day | had actually spent looking | Michael Dukakis 
we | had missed | some things 
her husband's financial dealings | caused | considerable controversy 
America | will be | Senator John Edwards 
the first step | is now | public reviewing of the candidate 
finances | are scoured | discussions 
what type of person | should | presidential candidates 
We | feel | the old days candidates 
a vice-presidential scholar | runs | a Web magazine 
anybody | is n't going to make | a good impression right 
people | do n't feel | the choice 
nothing | comes | the nominee 
We | 'll know | the level of success
