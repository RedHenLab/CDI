a lot of people | affect | America 
the whole world | hopes | the whole world 
We | have asked | Stephen Larrabee 
Georgia | is | the route of a very important pipeline 
this war | would have | important implications 
which | could spread and involve | Russia 
something | has to be worrying | every American 
we | heard | the Secretary of State Condeleezza Rice 
she | said | she 
they | had been meeting | he 
she | is hoping | peace 
no one | wants to get involved | a shooting war 
We | 're looking live now | protests 
People | speaking | this war 
the background | can see | the people 
a rally outside of the parliament building in Tbilisi | 's according | our Frederik Pleitgen 
President Mikheil Saakashvili | spoke | a moment 
the pipeline | is | third day 
they | are hitting | this pipeline 
he | thinks | the real purpose of this operation 
The real purpose of this operation | was to draw | a line 
the sand | to let | the west 
Russia | was not going to tolerate | anymore western encroachments 
the hopes | would humiliate and embarrass | Mikheil Saakashvili 
he | has been | the media holding press conferences 
he | has | no other alternative 
the west | involved | his army 
we | 're expecting | the French President Nicolas Sarkozy 
Mikheil Saakashvili | to hold | a press conference 
we | 're going to wait | that here 
the U.S. | comes | the election 
Russia | to secure | this pipeline 
the U.S. | is hunkered | Afghanistan 
Iraq | is | the verge of the changing 
the United States | is involved | an election campaign 
the United States | 's tied | Iraq and Afghanistan 
they | 're | the chief factor 
the Russians | felt | they 
they | consider | part of their sphere 
they | have been | the fact 
Georgia | might join | NATO 
they | have been | Saakashvili's pro-western course 
Stephen Larrabee | is | European security expert
