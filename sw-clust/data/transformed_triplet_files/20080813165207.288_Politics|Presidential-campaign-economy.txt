we | expect | the consumer 
we | will continue to see | the consumer 
Those rebate checks | were | a very short little burst 
we | are still seeing | a lot of stream 
we | 're seeing | the grocery stores 
we | do n't really see | any reason 
we | 're looking | things 
any kind of indication | 's going to be | a lot of corn and wheat and soybean 
maybe that | will help | prices 
we | seeing | the campaign 
we | going to see | policy makers 
We | talk | hydrogen cars 
We | can talk | a stimulus package 
the commercials | are playing out | McCain and Obama
