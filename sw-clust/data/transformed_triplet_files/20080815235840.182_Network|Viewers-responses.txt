this country | has been taken over | a parade of clowns 
Capitol Hill | will stand | the average American 
We | 're | serious need of a new party 
our taxes | were based | how much 
this administration | has helped | the legal working class 
Capitol Hill | would owe | several years of back payments 
the gall | to charge | baggage fees 
the airlines | stopped serving | decency 
cities | are allowed to provide | sanctuary 
We | need to start protecting | Americans 
we | should be protecting | both 
We | love | hearing
