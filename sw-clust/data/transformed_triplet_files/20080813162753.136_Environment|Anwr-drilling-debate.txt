we | wanted to have | a substantive discussion 
two of the people | whoa | re 
we | showed | we 
sort of | get | a sense 
the current energy lifeline | comes | Alaska 
your listeners | to know | this area 
we | seem to be | oil 
Right | called | the National Petroleum Reserve 
Democrats | posted | a bill 
the National Petroleum Reserve | build | a pipeline 
the Republicans | opposed | the Republicans 
we | 'd like to drill | the National Petroleum Reserve 
the Republicans | blocked | the effort 
we | flew | the National Petroleum Reserve 
We | saw | some oil facilities 
a great deal of drilling | goes | Alaska 
We | were | the beginning 
the choice | is n't drilling | one place 
We | need to be drilling | ANWR 
We | could continue to drill | the National Petroleum Reserve 
we | would have | a larger environmental footprint 
we | would do | the very fact that there 's a cease-fire at all 
we | would have | a smaller footprint 
we | would drill | the ANWR area 
we | should drill | both 
the 2 trillion barrels of oil | are | oil shell 
we | 're talking | all of those things 
We | need to do | VELSHI : Fortunately , we 're talking about all of those things . 
John McCain | is definitely getting | some traction 
We | 're seeing | more and more people 
Barack Obama | has said | the idea 
10 to 12 months | something | he 
people | tell | 10 to 12 
that last I | heard | John McCain 
we | have to get away | fossil fuels and dependence 
we | have to encourage | renewables 
the focus of the energy bill | should be | the focus 
Congress | have put | bills 
that 20 percent of our energy | needs | utilities 
We | 've been trying to take | the money 
the oil industry | give | the money 
commercial establishments | would use | the money 
We | 've tried to increase | the fuel efficiency of cars and trucks 
which | are | less independence 
The Republicans | keep saying | drill 
we | brought | both of you 
we | need to get | more fuel 
ISSUE # 1 | is | none of you 
your positions | wo n't look | ISSUE # 1 
D.C. | 'm going back | Washington 
this week | to speak | the floor 
we | should be | D.C. 
we | believe | Republicans 
We | do n't believe | members of Congress 
we | should decide | which form of energy 
We | think | the American people 
Let 's | legalize | energy production 
We | 're | the only country 
we | were | session 
the speaker | brought | all these bills 
renewables | take | the subsidy 
the oil companies | give | the subsidy 
the Republicans | oppose | this legislation 
Democrats | want | a comprehensive approach 
we | can take | this comprehensive approach 
the president | has to give | these other issues 
the president | is | less reliance

coming and | sharing | your views
