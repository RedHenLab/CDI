people | saying | the presidential campaign 
we | left | Youngstown 
we | 're headed | Toledo 
We | were | Pennsylvania 
they | 've heard | the candidates 
they | want to hear | more 
they | 're simply waiting | the spark 
the thing | 's really going to light | many of them 
we | talked | in 
a whole lot | 'm | kind of one 
each candidate | has to offer rather | their opponent 
Plenty of people | have | an idea of which 
she | 's leaning | Obama 
The last example says she 's leaning toward Obama right now , | comes down | the brass tax 
they | need to hear more | these candidates 
these candidates | are doing | all they 
we | 're | our way
