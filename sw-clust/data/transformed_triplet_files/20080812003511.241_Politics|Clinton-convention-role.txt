BROWN : Now , this | comes | the Clintons 
Hillary Clinton's team | was grabbing | headlines 
Barack Obama | chilling | the Aloha State 
she | campaigning | Obama 
she | want | Barack Obama 
Candy Crowley | has | the latest 
the outside | looks | Hillary Clinton 
She | was | campaigning 
not all of the Clinton troops | seem to be | line 
Obama | is offering | the Clintons 
She | will soon go | Florida 
He | was talking to ABC.com | the Edwards interview 
' affair | had hit prior | the Iowa caucuses 
' voters | were | the same people 
we | would have barely beaten | Obama 
our pollster | tells | `` Our voters and Edwards ' voters 
actually the plurality of people | were | Edwards 
' supporters | said | they 
they | want to put | forth unity 
the kind of thing | just kind of opens | those old wounds 
Lots of quotes | will not sit well | the Obama camp 
some of the bitterness | went | the primaries 
America | electing | a president 
a time of war | is | his center 
Here | will hit | a little close 
home | think | the Obama camp 
a good speech by Obama at the convention | is just | less than two weeks 
Senator Clinton | did lock | her speaking spot 
her supporters | may not give | Obama 
all | get | Denver 
her name | put | nomination 
We | have to vote | we 
they | could make | some noise 
whole picture of unity | would have | some problems
