The man | known | the Unabomber 
his 18-year mail bombing campaign | is back | the news 
He | is protesting | a museum exhibit 
Carol Costello | is covering | the story 
D.C. one | seeks to educate | visitors 
a museum exhibit | 's done | something 
prison | wrote | this letter 
a U.S. circuit court of appeals | complaining | an exhibit 
he | made | the bombs 
he | mailed | victims 
He | kept | some of the bomb-making materials 
he | had | things 
part of an exhibit | called | G Men 
The items | are | loan 
the Unabomber | to target | universities 
Kaczynski | did n't address | his letter 
Government | is | the public exhibition of the cabin 
publicity | connected | the Unabomber case 
The court | can draw | its own conclusions 
a strange statement | think | he 
he | has | feelings 
he | picked | a package 
Wright | feels | the exhibit 
a piece of history and people | saw | photos 
restitution | paid back | the folks 
insurance | did n't pay | anything 
Wright | has | no desire 
He | made | peace 
the Unabomber | was sentenced | years 
your cause | do n't know | exactly what 
he | dropped | his pencil 
two people | can barely fit | the two 
Kaczynski | put | the two 
He | used | some cases 
each corner | to hold | the thing 
He | was | the most hygienic of men 
He | slept up | that wall 
He | was | that cabin 
one of the curators | told | me 
the exhibit | is really | the relationship
