no decision | 'm going to make | Senators Barack Obama 
he | 's looking | a running mate 
he | 's courting to be | his V.P. 
pundits | have been looking | clues 
We | got | another one 
We | know | Evan Bayh 
Bill Richardson | will speak | Denver 
they | have speaking | roles 
they | 're no longer | contention 
All three names | have certainly been bandied | possible V.P.s. 
he | could use | a moderate 
a popular Southern governor | to help | a liberal 
Obama | needs | no help 
he | secured | the nomination 
the campaign trail | has looked and sounded | the series of tryouts
