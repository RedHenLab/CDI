These tiny bacteria | are making | diesel fuel 
the E. coli cells | are converting | the sugar 
a company | called | LS9 
E. coli | to make | fuel 
They | eat | sugar 
they | eat | sugar 
digest | expel | petroleum waste 
his team | have genetically engineered | these tiny oil makers 
E. coli | could make | other fuels 
We | 've genetically engineered | E. coli 
fuel | can be used | existing infrastructure 
LS9's E. coli diesel | can be mixed | traditional fossil fuels 
LS9 's E. coli diesel | can not be sent | existing pipelines 
an army of microbes | make | a difference 
something | can make | work 
NATL. | work | a very large scale 
they | are ramping | they 
They | hope to be making | millions of gallons 
a week | to say | we 
we | 're going to completely eliminate | our dependence 
they | get | the bugs out
