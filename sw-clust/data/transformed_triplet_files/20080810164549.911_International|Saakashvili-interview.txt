150 Russian tanks | have entered | the Georgian territories 
the whole hostility | erupted when | we 
the tanks | entering | the Georgian territory 
We | had | three days of fighting

Russian war planes | have now bombed | the international airport 
They | 've | targeted international airport 
they | blew up | the whole residential quarter 
they | hit | a residential area 
They | 've been continuously hitting | some companies

Russia | administered | this part 
Russian troops | entered in | here 
Russian troops | came | our border 
Russians | entered | yesterday 
They | had | hundreds 
they | 're here basically | this area 
the Russians | are now disputing | assertions 
your government | have pulled | your troops 
we | are speaking | South Ossetia 
We | are talking | mass 
the tank force | went | Afghanistan 
we | do n't have | an interest 
we | had | our troops 
we | relocated | the Russian troops and your troops 
they | 've completed | the task 
the Russian foreign minister | is denying | -LRB- CROSSTALK -RRB- BLITZER : Because they 're denying -- 
we | have | no interest 
Today I | was traveling | the road 
the air | belongs now | the Russians 
they | had to find | safe refuge 
Russian planes | were descending | very low 
the cars | dropping | bombs 
proximity of the place | was | a compilation of cars 
they | could n't do | anything 
we | need | to 
we | may lose | the satellite 
the satellite | will be | the explanation 
the world community | should stop intervention | invasion of my sovereign country 
the U.S. | has | lots of leverage 
much bigger things | are | stake 
the wider world | is | the future world order 
history | will judge very | people 
the United States | to offer | military assistance 
they | 've been really doing | a good job 
we | need to stop | hostility 
We | do n't need | further military action 
We | need to stop | the United States 
We | need to bring back | peace 
We | proclaimed | a cease-fire 
We | need to bring | peace 
me | play | this little clip 
he | leveled | a direct charge 
He | should be held | the barbaric and treacherous attack 
he | should be held | the aggression 
his troops | sign | a legally binding agreement 
END VIDEO CLIP | sounds | a little 
old times | remember | Brezhnev's times 
We | are talking | a place 
we | are talking | about 
we | controlled most | this area 
a small area | administered and run | the Russians 
they | talk | South Ossetian separatists 
this place | needs to get back | normal 
last week | were | Russian peacekeepers 
Russian peacekeepers | were | Georgian peacekeepers 
troops | should withdraw | sovereign Georgian territory 
we | should do | our best 
the areas | protect | the civilians 
we | have | the population 
this town of Tskhinvali | was | control of the Russian peacekeepers 
we | should do | our best 
the point | got | the point 
the point | 's just | a matter 
of | not anymore respecting | the borders 
we | have | such a natural boundary 
military | can compete | a superpower 
freedom | is | size 
Freedom | comes | sacrifice of your life 
we | need to halt | these hostilities 
the point | 's killing | people 
the point | 's killing | much more civilians 
the point | can ever kill | the troops 
Georgian troops | shot down | almost 20 of Georgian troops 
they | have | the air defenses 
they | got killed when | the whole residential area 
they | 're not equipped | air defenses 
we | can not supply | civilians on the ground 
the point | 's exactly doing | the point 
the point | 's | troops 
we | need | the point 
The Russians | say | your troops 
far as how many people | have been killed and injured so far | the course of these few days 
local Russian authorities | evacuated | most of the population 
we | responded when | after many hours of artillery barrage 
we | would n't respond | our side 
150 Russian tanks | are entering | our sovereign territory 
mountainous tunnel | called | the Rocky Tunnel 
we | could get | people 
artillery fire | to stop | mass land invasion of the sort 
me | interrupt | a second 
About 2,000 U.S. citizens | live | Georgia 
one | has to say | America 
one of the unexploded bombs | found | a shut down Russian plane 
the point | is | today 
the fire | entering | troops 
we | should halt | this violence
