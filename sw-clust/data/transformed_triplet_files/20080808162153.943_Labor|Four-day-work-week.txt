We | spoke | Utah Governor Jon Huntsman 
his state | decided to go | a four-day workweek 
We | 've got | a picture of sailboats 
people | get | a longer weekend 
They | 're commuting | one fewer day 
out | talked | some of the state workers 
we | 're just repackaging | the same number of hours per week 
a three-day weekend | can spend | a little more time 
we | try to recruit | the next generation of state employees 
the quality of life | looms | the minds of a lot 
some of the kinks | 've faced | this week 
they | deal | extended education opportunities 
we | 're working | our public transportation authority 
this size | has ever gone forward | a workweek 
We | 're | kind of the first 
we | 're going to run | a few obstacles 
we | 'll have | most of them 
we | 'll have | several underlying metrics 
one of them | talked | me 
an energy | saving | some workers 
they | drive | four days 
some of these buildings | do n't have to keep | operation 
Have | got | any data 
we | 're going to be throttling back | Thursday night 
the cars | 're taking | the road 
My return home | was | much faster 
some unanticipated positive consequences and implications | think | we 
Anybody sort | thinking | this idea 
many | are thinking | Anybody sort of thinking about this idea in their own state ? 
November | gets | CHRISTINE ROMANS 
we | 'll make | the decision
