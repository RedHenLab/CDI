Jack Kennedy | did when | he 
Jack Kennedy | was | a friend of mine 
Jack Kennedy | 're | no Jack Kennedy 
Dukakis | lost | the election 
Many analysts | say | hindsight 
Bentsen | was actually | a bad choice 
He | had | too much charisma 
vice presidents | have | both 
We | asked | historian Lee Edwards of the conservative Heritage Foundation 
Edwards | sees | Dick Cheney 
George W. Bush | made | a good choice 
he | brought | lots of Washington experience 
the nominee | did n't have | the time 
Richard Nixon | would be | No 
Republican Dwight Eisenhower | brought more | youth and California balance 
Nixon | had | other assets 
which | became | huge liabilities 
he | ended | the White House 
Richard Nixon | was known | the man 
Al Gore | gets | No 
Gore | was | a good choice 
he | brought | Washington experience 
a ticket | featuring | a little-known governor 
the primary , Bush | joined | Ronald Reagan in the primary 
the ticket | helped unite | the party 
best choice of a presidential running mate | goes | Lyndon Johnson 
someone | to balance | Democratic presidential nominee John Kennedy 
Lyndon Johnson | was | the man 
he | delivered | Texas 
which | helped | John Kennedy 
He | might have been | a great choice 
Republican Spiro Agnew | would be | No. 3 
he | helped get | Richard Nixon 
Agnew | pleaded | no contest 
he | had been | governor of Maryland 
the Republican John Kennedy | quickly became | a laughing stock 
Jack Kennedy | was | a friend of mine 
Democratic Senator Thomas Eagleton | gets | conservative historian Lee Edwards 
Eagleton | was quickly dumped | reports 
nervous exhaustion | given | electroshock treatments 
camera | made | the candidate 
And | made | the nominee look 
he | picked | Edwards 
he | did n't do | enough serious investigation 
that presumptive nominees | ignore | presumptive nominees peril
