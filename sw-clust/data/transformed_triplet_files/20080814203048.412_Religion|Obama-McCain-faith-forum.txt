One of America's most influential spiritual leaders | will bring together | the men 
Pastor Rick Warren | will moderate | a live faith forum 
He | is also | the author of the best-selling book 
THE PURPOSE | DRIVEN | LIFE 
we | 're going to see | the candidates 
We | 're actually going to look | four different areas 
The first segment of questioning | is going to be | the stewardship of the presidency 
we | 're going to talk | leadership 
a half-a-million leaders | have gone | training 
We | 're going to talk | competence of leadership 
no matter | answer | leaders 
we | will deal | some of that 
we | 're going to look | America's role 
We | 're | the most blessed nation 
our role | helping | less fortunate nations 
our role in helping less fortunate nations | comes | what kind of leader 
they | can prepare | Yes 
Yes | to give | me 
they | handle | a crisis 
the presidency | deal | things 
they | change | Yes minds 
Yes | to make | decisions 
they | make | tough decisions 
a lot of different things | can deal | the life of a leader 
town halls or debates | tend to do | hot-button political issues

2004 | was | just two weeks 
Christians | should consider when | they 
many people | thought | really helped President Bush 
2004 | was | the right thing 
the right thing | to do | me 
this forum | is | me 
me | to push | bias 
me | to provide | an open forum 
John McCain | to share | their views 
they | 're | imperfect men 
they | 're also | good men 
a pastor | to shepherd | all the flock 
that 70 percent of evangelicals | are | McCain 
McCain | has | such an advantage 
a poll from `` TIME '' magazine that says that 70 percent of evangelicals are for McCain , 19 percent for Obama , 11 percent for the undecided | comes | evangelicals 
They | 're | a monolithic bloc 
the press | tries to make | evangelicals vote 
they | 're not convinced | either of these men 
They | may be | believers 
They | may be | Christians 
they | would say | John McCain 
they | like | portions of both campaigns and portions 
some issues | are | others 
those | take | precedence 
Yes | depends | the voter 
Everybody | has | a world view 
Everybody | has | a hierarchy of values 
she | gets | an education 
she | lives | poverty 
she | has | AIDS or not 
a lot of people | disagree | me 
We | have to ... | MALVEAUX 
either one of these candidates | having | kind of that whole life agenda
