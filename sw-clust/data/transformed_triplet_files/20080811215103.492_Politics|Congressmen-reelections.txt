Everybody | hates | Congress 
they | 're | vacation 
they | wind up | staying 
Lenny | writes | New York 
My congressman | replaced | an incumbent Republican 
others | will do | the same 
we | watch | the store 
November | to remove | these people 
the proverbial yellow dog | support | a member of the Republican Party 
My question | was why | he 
his fellow congressman | were always | recess 
The conference call | was terminated | my question 
the House | reflect | my beliefs 
your life | vote | any incumbent 
my country | to reward | the people 
a Republican | 're | a Republican 
a Republican | have | Senator David Vitter 
a Republican | 're | a Democrat 
a Republican | have | Congressman William Jefferson 
look | yours 
We | post | hundreds of them
