she | is still | vogue today 
we | 're talking | Madonna 
She | turns | 50 
a woman | continues | rock and shock 
a half century | might slow | this show biz icon 
she | emerged | the '80s 
people's approval | doing | the right thing 
she | was | all those things 
she | did n't care | what anyone thought 
women | found | very liberating 
she | 's been rocking | People 
The Vatican | called | the past 25 blonde ambition tour 
The couple | denies | their marriage 
the next couple of days | has n't stopped | the tabloids 
Italian Catholic decision | to adopt | a young Malawian boy 
the old Madonna | might be passed | this MADONNA -LRB- singing -RRB- sell 
my legs | 'm not going to wear | something age appropriate 
she | 's done really well | herself 
she | 's done so much | her music 
-LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- | is just | the next 40

Madonna | turns | 50 
she | shows | no signs
