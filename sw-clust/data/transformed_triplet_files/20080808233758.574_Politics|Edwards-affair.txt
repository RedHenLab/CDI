We | will have | three of the best political analysts 
They | will be | more and all the day's political news 
me | to talk | the impact 
the John Edwards sex scandal | will have | the Democratic Convention 
we | have | three of the best political analysts 
We | have | Republican strategist Ed Rollins 
Ed | was | White House political director 
he | chaired | Mike Huckabee's campaign 
We | have syndicated | columnist Miguel Perez 
He | is also | a Barack Obama supporter 
We | have | quite a bit of news today 
the stupidity of this man | is | anything 
The first thing | want | a man 
he | ran twice | president 
He | showed | no judgment 
He | does n't have | a moral integrity 
someone | tells | the truth 
he | does n't tell | the truth 
we | 're | all human 
a discipline | 're running | office 
Edwards | has endorsed | Barack Obama 
terms | think | SYNDICATED 
He | 's still denying | the child 
He | 's taking | the public opinion 
PILGRIM | does | point 
a scandal | is | one party 
itself | was | a certainly unchivalrous statement 
John Edwards ' statement itself | left | more questions 
John Edwards ' statement itself | provided | answers 
so many people | share | his beliefs 
Edwards | was | a unique role 
the way Al Gore | focused | global warming 
he | was | Los Angeles 
a documentary | to try to accomplish | the same things 
he | 's now betrayed | his supporters 
terms | speaking | effectively 
He | can name | the documentary 
his personal life | is | some criticism 
ZIMMERMAN | discredits | Republican strategist Ed Rollins 
ZIMMERMAN | 's going to continue to be | a problem 
ZIMMERMAN | 's also going to confront | so many supporters of his 
so many supporters of his mission and political action | be defined | his conduct 
Barack Obama | had already named | Robert 
This guy | was being named | potential attorney general 
these guys | play | fire 
Do | want to be | Mr. Clean 
this affair | went | 2006 
He | claims | he 
he | did | this understanding the environment 
he | should n't have run | president 
the candidate | have | an obligation 
their party | to actually come | anything 
their background | might cause | a basic scandal 
Obama | would have asked | Robert 
your past | 's going to hurt | me 
Ed | has certainly been | the leaders 
most campaigns | do | the leaders in national campaigns own opposition research 
themselves | to make | nothing 
the opposition research | 's going to be | an issue 
the opposition research | goes back | Ed's point 
a lot of Democrats | really went | John Kerry 
many of his people | took | shots 
Edwards | conducted | himself 
the other question | 's really hanging | this entire situation 
mainstream press | will not push too hard | these sort of issues 
The National Enquirer | is carrying | a story 
a story | does n't make | a story 
the mainstream media | should have followed | this story 
the mainstream media | to follow | the stories 
mainstream media | was | The National Enquirer 
a test case with Russia | relates | sex 
the tragedy | suffering | cancer 
she | has -- | everything 
she | was | a champion 
all | made | right now 
they | were certainly watching | the mainstream 
the part of the press | to actually push | that too hard 
very visible press conference | was held | John Edwards 
he | was running | president 
Mr. Edwards | was taking | advantage of that situation
