no doubt | celebrating | KEILAR second place finish 
Clinton's name | will be placed | nomination 
We | are | Iowa 
This state | barely went | Al Gore 
a caucus state | 's being hotly contested | this year 
the party | putting | Clinton's name 
the question | think | a question 
something | to do | Clinton's name 
a deal | was made | Barack Obama 
they | wanted to make | Hillary Clinton's supporters 
A party | -LRB- | INAUDIBLE 
the democratic nomination | to win | primaries 
the fact | is | Hillary Clinton 
INAUDIBLE | to make | the nomination of Barack Obama unanimous 
they | will | all support Barack Obama 
they | do want | that recorded and Barack Obama

One judge | said | One

We | heard | the associated press 
another judge | has said | no 
the convention | turns | the way 
Obama | gets | the nomination 
an Obama | pledged | superdelegate 
the Obama campaign | is not disappointed | the judge's decision 
Mayor Kilpatrick | was | the convention 
he | 'd be | a story 
four days | advertising | the candidate 
they | do n't want | any distractions 
They | would all be going | that story 
They | 'd be asking | all the delegates 
he | leave | office 
he | should go | jail 
Everyone | would be asked | the American voters opinion 
he | 'd be | part of the story 
the CNN Election Express | makes | its way
