we | 've been hearing | a lot of buzz 
John McCain pledge | to serve | just one term 
McCain | make | this work 
Ed Henry | has been | digging 
We | 're going to go back | Ed 
Ed | could be | the jolt 
They | 're focused | other things 
They | do n't want to go | this road 
something | would be | a big jolt 
John McCain | announced | they 
Washington's | not getting | anything 
let's | try to shake | right now 
he | 'd be categorizing | himself 
President Bush | had | a lot more clout 
he | is | the debate 
he | does n't have | a lot of juice 
Capitol Hill | to get | things 
things done | is | the very end 
the Republicans | looking past | the president 
Nancy Pelosi | saying | do 
we | deal | this president 
2012 | might also bring | more attention 
the age issue | suggest maybe | John McCain's nervous 
he | 's only going to serve | one term 
we | 're hearing | various advisers 
the end what we 're hearing from various advisers | could be | a very bold gambit 
the end what we 're hearing from various advisers | carries | so much risk 
Ed Henry | tonight working | two stories 
he | take | the plunge 
Steve Hayes | feels | a little bit gimmicky 
a chance | to interview | Senator McCain today 
he | said | This little lie -LRB- ph -RRB- option ? 
he | 's got | consideration 
He | seems | This little lie -LRB- ph -RRB- option ? 
This little lie -LRB- ph -RRB- option ? | has | recent days 
He | said | This little lie -LRB- ph -RRB- option ? 
The one place | would say | one 
he | picks | Joe Lieberman 
he | could go | the country 
We | are going to fix | these problems 
We | 're going to take | four years 
three years | might be | a way 
he | picks | Lieberman 
Lieberman | making | three years 
the Republican Party | warmed | John McCain 
some ways | may be looking | sort of a do 
they | 're | happy 
they | 'd like to see | Senator John McCain 
they | think | they 
a better candidate | run | the real candidate 
they | wanted to see | this year 
sort | eliminating | politics 
this even sort of | up | the next 48 months 
this even sort | have | the reverse effect 
the lame duck issue | to speak | front and center 
the lame duck issue | goes | this idea 
he | 's talking | a movement 
he | does | four years 
we | 're going to have | the countdown watch 
We | 're going to have | the one-term watch 
we | got | a lot 
we | take | a quick break 
Steve | did talk | McCain 
a lot of people | get | these days 
He | 's quite | the press 
the most striking thing | was | probably our discussion 
He | has n't really talked | this much 
reporters of late and | asked | his potential running mate 
we | had actually had back | February 
he | said picking | a pro-choice running mate 
he | seemed to back | a little bit 
we | 're | a pro-life party 
we | should n't disqualify | someone 
right now | may or may not be | he 
Joe Lieberman | was sitting | the row right 
he | did n't mention | Joe Lieberman 
we | 're | the face 
an interesting turn | to | me 
evangelical leaders | would not be | comment 
they | 'd be passed | the floor 
they | would need smelling | salts 
They | would need smelling | salts 
he | floated | BRODY : Because if that were ever to happen , evangelical leaders probably would not be available for comment because they 'd be passed out on the floor and they would need smelling salts .
