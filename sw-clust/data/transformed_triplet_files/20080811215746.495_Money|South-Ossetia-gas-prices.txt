Our Lou Dobbs | has been keeping | an eye 
we | heard | President Bush 
We | 're hearing very little | the United Kingdom 
Germany | is | stake 
they | do n't have | the courage 
they | are | Russia 
dependency | is rising | a rate of about 10 percent 
They | are | Europe 
they | are acting | they 
they | are not going to | any way 
Which | may explain why | we 
the United Nations Security Council consultations | are going | right 
France | is looking to water | very tough language 
the United States | wanted | Russia 
they | are playing | a very dangerous game 
We | 've seen | a very dangerous game 
we | know | our audience 
history | has | a very unfortunate cycle 
a very dangerous game | repeats and to see | the way 
this administration | is asserting | itself 
the powers of Europe | do not have | the sense 
the responsibility | to act | they 
the responsibility to act as they should and what they should do | should not be | our responsibility
