Gallup | did | a poll 
they | talked to say | they 
they | 're going to vote | either Obama or McCain 
They | may nominally be | two major parties 
only one establishment | devoted | welfare , war and power 
they | get | fair coverage 
people | will take | note of those third party candidates 
we | had | Ron Paul 
He | got | a lot of exposure 
the clear choice | to lead | America 
The only reason people | continue to vote | one of the two parties 
because most people | do n't take | the time 
They | go | the political wind 
the politicians | do | Washington 
the media | do n't pay | attention 
the electorate | does n't know | much 
these candidates | ca n't raise | money 
the main thing | to have | a successful campaign 
America | needs | a home 
look | yours
