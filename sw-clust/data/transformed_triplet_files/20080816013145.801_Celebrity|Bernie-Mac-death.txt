He | lit up | the room 
He | was | everybody 
He | was almost | a Santa Claus 
a lot of fun | talking | LUKE WILSON , ACTOR : He just could not have been more kind and personable . 
We | 're back | D.L. Hughley 
Ashton Kutcher | paying | tribute 
Mac's the kind of person | ca n't get | enough of 
she | had | any scenes 
Mac | was | the kind of person 
the movie what impression necessarily he made | left | six months 
He | would be | the middle of a joke 
He | had | that kind of sharp 
he | left | Demi 
he | was | a constant 
He | was | just a solid individual 
Bernie | reminds | me 
an old cat | asked how | he 
she | tells | me 
she | puts | front of me 
she | 's going to feed | me 
she | 's never going to tell | me 
nothing | hurts | me 
Bernie | felt | that way 
Ashton | did n't just co-star | Bernie Mac 
Let | 's take | a look 
Bernie Mac | is going to be riding | the car 
Have | ever been | that stoplight 
we | 're doing | Bernie 
Tell Hawk | to run | Tell Hawk 
all those people | running | light 
guys | need to stop running | red lights 
all | need to get | your job 
they | call | me 
Bernie | bought | the whole Hollywood thing 
Bernie | was | a family man 
he | loved | Rhonda 
he | loved | his daughter 
He | did n't buy | any of the ground level 
we | would all go | after parties 
Bernie | did n't buy | none of Bernie Mac 
we | bought | right now 
We | were | all of the parties 
the hush | falls | the crowd 
we | did | the Schlitz Malt Liquor 
these | were | the Kings of Comedy 
he | would always stop | a gas station 
he | would also get | an MGD 
we | 'd stay up | all night 
He | was always | the same 
Thanks | having | me 
Steve | will come back | the end of the program
