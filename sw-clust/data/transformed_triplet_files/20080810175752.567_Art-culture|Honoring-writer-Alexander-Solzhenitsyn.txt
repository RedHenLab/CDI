the pen | is | the sword 
whose words | helped bring | the Soviet empire 
Once | honored | Alexander Solzhenitsyn 
Alexander Solzhenitsyn | was | a young man 
he | referred disrespectfully | Soviet leader Josef Stalin 
he | memorized | his ideas 
he | had committed | memory 12,000 lines 
Solzhenitsyn | introduced | the world 
which | was | gulag 
photographs | travel as quickly | they 
how powerful | are written | words
