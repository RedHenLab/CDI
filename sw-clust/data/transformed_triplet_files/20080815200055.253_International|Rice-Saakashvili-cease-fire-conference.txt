The United States | is delivering | a stern new warning 
Russia | to get | its troops 
a cease-fire | just signed | the former Soviet republic 
Georgia's president | signed | the cease-fire plan 
he | will sign | the agreement 
the Russians | will withdraw | its forces 
we | are looking | evil 
Georgia | is growing | the day 
Russia | intervened | a dispute 
CNN's Michael Ware | is | the ground 
Now | is | the eastern front of this war 
the Russians | attacked | two fronts 
which | has received | very little attention 
Now | was thought to be | Russian occupation 
we | found | indeed 
They | had sunk | a number of Georgian vessels 
They | were conducting | armored patrols of the city 
they | were not controlling | the city 
we | 've since heard | Georgian officials 
small element | has just pulled | the seaport 
we | discovered | we 
the western front | is | fact 
a much larger Russian force | is | presence 
We | saw | Russian artillery 
fields | covered | camouflage 
We | saw | numerous tanks 
hundreds of troops | seem to have taken | barracks 
a key intersection | cuts | the country 
the Russians | are doing | quite the opposite 
they | seem to be pressing | Georgian officials advantage 
The area | 're talking | about 
the Russians | have | a substantial presence 
CNN 's Michael Ware | 's going to work | much more 
the cards | remain | Russia's favor 
we | see | the western front 
the flash point | started | South Ossetia 
the east , Russia | used | an invitation 
they | did n't stop there | they 
They | pressed further south | Georgia proper 
we | witnessed | the western town of Senaki 
Now | 's going to have | major implications 
Now | 's certainly going to be | an extremely effective bargaining tool 
Georgia | allows | the Russians 
they | can keep | their troops 
a so-called compromise | to merely pull | their troops 
Condoleezza Rice | is calling | the cease-fire plan 
Russia | needs to happen | next 
Russian forces | need to leave | Georgia 
The world | needs to help | Georgia
