the Georgia | is broken | pieces 
We | are talking | middle of Georgian territory

we | came | attack 
we | called | a number of other friendly nations 
we | are | trouble 
we | asked | U.S. officials 
they | knew | Russia 
they | understood | Russia 
they | have | nothing 
the second | is to react | Russian intervention 
nothing | was done | secret 
we | were appealing and reaching | the world 
we | are | trouble 
every international mechanism | has failed | that moment 
now | is pretty late | many things 
terms | bringing | people 
people households | start | the restoration process 
Georgia | to be broken | pieces 
the process | building | some kind of peace 
developments | break | the NEWSROOM
