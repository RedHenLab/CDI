he | was | the best parent 
END VIDEO CLIP | was | his wife 
the father of the year | was keeping | a secret 
He | had been having | an affair 
a filmmaker | named | Rielle Hunter 
Let | 's take | a look 
She | 's been called | the mistress

Hunter and Edwards | had | chemistry 
They | became | one another 
Hunter | traveled | the country 
many documentaries | called | Webisodes 
which | were supposed to give | voters 
scenes | look | the real John Edwards 
some plastic Ken doll | put | in front of audiences 
She | traveled | COOPER 
Africa | to highlight | his campaign 
She | said | she 
that trip | called | the experience life-altering 
He | was | me 
The Edwards campaign | paid | her close 
Little | is known | Hunter's past 
a Florida native | is born | Lisa Druck 
She | lived | Los Angeles

He | said | an affair 
the other | is going to be | the money question 
she | 's been paid | $ 15,000 
the other | comes | the finance chairman 
the money | come | the houses 
this story | is going to have | lots of legs 
he | has | a responsibility 
We | have n't even seen | the interview 
Senator Edwards | gave where | he 
everyone | makes | a judgment 
he | needs to do | at least let people 
Edwards | styled | himself 
he | wanted to be | these audiences 
against corporate interests | look | the little guy 
he | sold | this story 
everyone | was representing | the establishment 
people | were representing | powered interests 
he | understood where | the truth 
he | was going to expose | the lies 
he | was living | a lie 
he | was portraying | himself 
a lie | was | a compartmentalized part 
he | was hiding | this lie 
the statement | is where | he 
this egocentrism and narcissism | developed | this egocentrism and narcissism 
this egocentrism and narcissism | misled | this egocentrism and narcissism 
what kind of effect | does it have | his judgment 
a man | wanted to have | the highest office 
he | live | a world of some compartmentalization 
He | was taking | a big gamble 
he | was allowing | himself 
he | was no longer | sound judgment 
the program | talk | Paul Begala

they | 've come | the day 
just | to go | this point 
other people | wanted to be | president 
they | had | an issue 
they | did n't think | Jennifer 's point of view 
Jennifer 's point of view | was | their families party 
somebody | 've had | a love child

advice not | to run | that year 
he | violated | trust 
We | 're going to ... | PALMIERI 
Senator Edwards | did do | a conference call today 
terms | putting | the candidacy 
We | 're going to have to leave | ... 
we | know | a lot 
Elizabeth Edwards | learned | her husband's affair 
he | 's running | the presidency 
She | let | on 
remarkable strength | has been tested | the years 
we | 've seen | this story 
they | do | a steep price 
We | 'll look | that ahead 
other spouses , husbands and family | need to be | supportive 
she | was diagnosed | breast cancer 
John Kerry | had just lost | the presidential election 
The race | was still | full swing 
Mrs. Edwards | discovered | a lump 
campaign appearances | finally getting | the cancer diagnosis hours 
Kerry | conceded | the race 
she | could soldier | The race 
we | know | she 
She | knew | the affair 
The only thing | hurts | me 
Elizabeth Edwards | said | a word 
she | faced | her disease 
her husband | to press | the presidency 
the things | did | last week 
The couple | met | the University of North Carolina Law School 
both | took | the bar exam 
the birth of four children | mourned | the loss of one 
They | enjoyed | the meteoric rise of John's career 
tomorrow | will be | a better day 
they | stood together | the falls 
the election | was | November 3rd 
Elizabeth Edwards | has become | her own right 
we | have | we 
she | continues to impress | fans 
she | seems to do | a pretty good job 
gay rights | created | waves 
somebody else's marriage | has | anything 
FOREMAN | -LRB- | camera -RRB- 
she | stayed | E. EDWARDS : I do n't know why somebody else 's marriage has anything to do with me . 
This latest news | is undeniably | a terrible thing 
She | 's dealt | the death of a son 
She | 's dealt | cancer 
a lot of things | suspect | she 
FOREMAN | -LRB- | voice 
they | have dealt | many issues 
He | will certainly not be | the last 
the lawmakers | caught | scandal 
we | 've learned | the past 
John Edwards | may have tried to offer | some sort of rationale 
Edwards | said | he 
he | cheated | his wife 
his story | is | high profile politicians 
We | 've seen | the story 
power | seem to have | power who 
Erica Hill | takes | a look 
a politician | spoke | his deep religious faith and values 
Idaho senator Larry Craig | was | a champion of family values 
he | was arrested | alleged lewd conduct 
your foot | was close | mine 
Disgraced former New York governor Eliot Spitzer | ran | that office 
Some public officials | may not want to face | stricter ethics rules 
all citizens | will win when | we 
a government | puts | the people's interests 
HILL | : | Earlier this year 
Spitzer | stepped down | allegations 
he | 'd used | a high-priced escort service 
the hypocrisy | is often | the most disturbing part of a political scandal 
Florida congressman Mark Foley | made | a name 
himself | working to protect | kids 
only | to resign | suggestive text messages 
he | sent | a former teenage page 
One of the most memorable political scandals | was | 20 years 
Bill Clinton | has been | down this road 
none of those alleged indiscretions | kept | Bill Clinton 
the White House | continuing | his successful speaking and diplomacy career 
John Edwards | can follow | Clinton's path 
We | 're joined now | Alex Castellanos 
He | lied | his friends 
he | lied | his staff 
he | lied | the voters 
politicians | went | affairs 
n't many politicians | 've had | an affair 
he | done | better 
he | come back | COOPER 
CASTELLANOS | was just | an affair 
his wife | was | cancer 
some characters | get shot | the end of the first act 
' | released | just a few hours 
my wife | 've humiliated | my wife publicly 
the hell | was way | too self referential 
He | needed to say | a lot 
a lawyer or somebody | 'd been | the national scene 
he | thinks | he 
that most folks | looking | this situation 
he | references | this statement 
Politico | is reporting | he 
he | can show up | he 
he | 's got | some delegates of his own 
your head | 're caught | a sex scandal 
We | 're going to have | more right 
We | 're joined again | Republican consultant Alex Castellanos 
reporters | bringing | this issue 
flat-out | denied having | a relationship 
your campaign | provided | any financial support 
anyone | affiliated | your presidential campaign 
' political action committee | paid | Rielle Hunter almost $ 115,000 
maybe some of his friends | gave | her money 
he | did n't know | anything 
we | know why | his campaign slogan 
front of voters | saying | something 
the world | is | the shape 
trust | is going to become | a much bigger issue 
Republicans and Democrats | going forward | this election 
a paternity test | to prove | he 
now | 's going to have | a big impact 
He | 's | the ticket 
He | 's not running | anything 
He | does n't serve | any public office 
He | did n't violate | the Geneva convention 
He | did | water board 
He | did n't order | the CIA 
we | have | serious problems 
the presidential campaign | should be focused | those problems 
John Edwards | had | an affair 
your presidential campaign provided any financial help to Rielle Hunter or Andrew Young | would be used | Republicans 
he | said | no comment 
Anybody | sees | a politician 
this for their own political gain , that tells you what kind of person | has | an impact 
voters | need to know | they 
the stands | take | on issues 
voters | are going to get | voters magnifying glass 
a man | might have been | president 
Elizabeth Edwards | are saying | the affair
