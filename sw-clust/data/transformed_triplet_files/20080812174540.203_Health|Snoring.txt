your snoring | is keeping | your partner 
new ways | to stop | all this noise 
my house | snored | me 
the CNN NEWSROOM | drove | me 
My room | was | my sister's 
a lot of people | do n't know | people 
They | 're | a little bit 
a doctor | can go | your soft pallet 
the back of your throat | put | some implants 
all | getting | a lot of air 
the airway | becomes | sort of compromised 
sort of compromised | is when | people 
Snoring | is just | an issue of gee 
my spouse | is keeping | me 
apnea | can be | a very dangerous condition

what if | 're | heavy of a snorer 
what things | do | your own 
some things | can do | your own 
we | should make | this No. 1 
We | had | a doctor 
a 15-pound weight gain | can start | patients who need to travel for life-saving medical treatment 
a horrific snorer | to get | those
