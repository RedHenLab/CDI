Let | go back | Chad Myers 
a little bit | 's happening | New York 
another storm | can develop | the first one 
the Hudson | 're looking | Hoboken 
very well | could get | Manhattan 
itself | would have to rotate | that camera 
the right | go | the Palisades 
we | could tilt | that other shot 
that other shot | was probably | a lightning strike 
camera | took at least | the power 
We | 're getting | a little bit of tilt 
the G.W. Bridge | is exactly where | that storm 
The rotation | is wrapped | a blanket of rain 
no way | to see | the tornado 
your neighbor | live | an apartment 
third | 's | the floor 
We | have | a brand new 
we | 're talking | Southern Westchester County 
A brand new tornado | warning just handed | me 
This purple box | 's going to be | the middle of that box 
We | do n't have to worry | the cone of these boxes 
itself | moving | the east-northeast
