Senator John McCain's | been getting | a lot of attention 
Let | 's take | a listen 
he | 's been | Washington's biggest celebrity 
Washington | embraced | UNIDENTIFIED MALE : John McCain ! 
the lobbyists | running | his low-road campaign 
We | hear | a lot 
they | are based | facts 
the Cybercast News Service | goes | a core issue 
the liberal media | is not going to carry | the message of the McCain campaign 
they | should n't carry | the message of the Obama campaign 
these candidates | are going to get | Both candidates message out 
they | have to get | the message of the Obama campaign 
they | think | the other guy 
the so-called liberal media | is | the tank 
we | can have | that debate 
the public | can see | The most devastating ad 
that Barack Obama | has been saying | this campaign 
they | are going to have to pay to get | this campaign 
we | referred | before 
Let | 's take | a quick 
We | 're usually | REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE AD 
REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE AD | 's been | all day 
We | know | he 
he | has | very soft eyes 
The ad | is called | Fan Club 
a strength of the candidate | turn | a strength of the candidate 
That ad | is going | a few atmospherics 
Obama | seems to be running sometimes | president of the world 
an ad | used exactly | what Obama 
he | gave | Berlin 
Obama | said | that speech 
we | saw | that ad 
they | used | a lot of young people 
they | view | the Obama campaign

Barack Obama's leadership | saying | he 
millions of followers | does n't make | a lot of sense 
he | 's inspired | a whole new generation of Americans 
John Kennedy | did back | John McCain 
an inconsistent message | to say | he 
he | has | millions of people 
The tactic | meets | media 
that Barack Obama | has said | this campaign 
he | is | full repeal of the Defense 
the platform committee of the Democratic Party | forwarded | a platform 
we | oppose | the Defense of Marriage Act 
they | 're going have to put | Saturday 
he | have | a point 
he | pay | full price 
he | did n't say | an ethical negative ad 
The first thing he | is | the public record 
The first thing he | needs to be | about something 
a campaign | are doing | ads 
this town | go when | they
