close calls | to get | the air 
reporters | put | themselves 
CNN's Zain Verjee | got hit | a tear gas canister 
They | will start | firing 
reporters | fear | gas attacks 
He | 's putting | the gas masks 
Now a reporter | does n't have to be | a war zone 
a trouble spot | to have | a close call 
the giant jaws of the hippo | were | no match 
The atmosphere | has been | the last hours 
this reporter | covering | an alleged real estate scam 
he | got whacked | a plastic bottle 
no close call | seemed closer | a giant snake
