Bernie Mac | told | David Letterman 
He | said | he 
he | wanted to enjoy | his life 
he | would have probably retired | stand 
stand - up | was | a grind 
he | would ever stop | entertainment 
The disease | was | Cedric 
He | wanted to entertain | people 
a lot | heard | STEVE HARVEY : I mean , you know , Bernie was in your face . 
He | was | too big 
Bernie Mac | to tell | jokes 
Bernie Mac's family | is asking | donations 
death | has | a way 
somebody | will say | something

He | was | a man's man 
We | 'll love and miss | only Bernie Mac
