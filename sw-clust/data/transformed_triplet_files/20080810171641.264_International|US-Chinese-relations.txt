We | should engage | China 
We | have to probably hedge | a little bit 
we | 've basically taken | the same approach 
we | have | a bipartisan consensus 
we | do n't want | a cold war 
We | do n't miss | the Cold War 
the Cold War | substituting | China 
we | should try to develop | a basis 
cooperation | maintaining | our own military strength 
these kind of tensions | have happened | Japan 
these kind of tensions | is | me 
they | do n't happen | Germany 
China | is really | an open society 
the Chinese | taking | American jobs 
an American company | has decided to lower | its manufacturing costs 
China | 's actually resented | the Chinese people 
China | comes | China's scale 
we | talk | Germany 
they | are compared | China 
China | can have | gigantic effect 
China's military spending | is really | the U.S. 
China | scares | the American people 
this regime | seems very committed | good relations 
They | do not trust | another powerful country 
China | will be | American suspicions 
the Chinese Communist Party | may not actually have | a lot of confidence 
a superpower | is run | a different political system 
Let | 's compare | U.S. policy 
The U.S. | trusts | India 
India | makes | lots more problems 
they | do not want to create | a direct clash 
Bush | comes | office 
he | 's going to be | the most pro-freedom president 
he | has actually sided | Beijing 
the Chinese government | sees | Bush 
he | has actually been | more pro-Beijing 
which | was | the signal 
American support | do | the status quo 
was | a fundamental change

the Chinese government | could stop | the U.N. 
President Bush | got personally frustrated | the previous Taiwan president 
he | was pushing | legal independence 
He | held | a referendum 
Taiwan | declaring | formal independence 
a referendum | would probably trigger | a Chinese , perhaps military , response 
we | have | a kind of moral and legal commitment 
Bush | has handled | China relations 
his decision | to go | the games 
his decision to go to the games | would have caused | such a loss of face 
his decision to go to the games | would be | China 
he | gets | the next few days 
he | did n't do | China 
they | will respond positively | ZAKARIA 
he | realizes | Tibet 
the Chinese people | support | the government 
the sense | supporting | enormous independence claims 
the Dalai Lama | is making | overtures 
we | do not know | how serious 
such overture | will be taken seriously | the games 
the Chinese government | will have | the time 
ZAKARIA : Is China post-Olympics going to look different ? | going to look | more 
any one leader | to take | a bold initiative and sort of sell 
a bold initiative and sort of sell | market | a bold initiative and sort of sell 
Tibet | tends to make | things 
he | met | Clinton 
he | decided | the last minute 
Hu Jintao | would allow | such a thing 
the kind of bold policy initiative | would require to resolve | Tibet
