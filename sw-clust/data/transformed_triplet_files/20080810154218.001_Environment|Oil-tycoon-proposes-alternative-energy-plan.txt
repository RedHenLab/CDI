we | ca n't drill | our way 
Let | 's discuss | that plan 
plenty of billions | 're spending | a lot of money 
America | weaned | its addiction 
the only person | understood | the energy situation 
A lot of people | agree | me 
about 95 percent of the people | coming | my Web site 
we | 're | foreign oil 
we | 're spending | $ 700 billion 
the work | 're doing | people 
Texas | going up | Canada 
We | 've had | huge turnout 
They | fill up | the hall 
they | turn | people 
the lines | 're advocating to use | solar and wind 
a Republican , | 've always been | a Republican 
my $ 58 million | to inform | the American people 
we | ca n't go any further | the operation 
we | can solve | the operation 
we | have | an abundance of natural gas 
The idea | goes | the trucks 
the solar , | use | the wind 
the wind | 's going to take | a long 
long time | to get | going 
the technology | is | place 
corridors | to transmit | the power 
They | will have to give | corridors 
the authorization | to use | wind 
Eisenhower | did | the interstate highway system 
terms | taking | land 
Senator Obama | says | a new ad 
a drilling plan | wo n't produce | a drop of oil 
a $ 1,000 tax cut | to help | families 
we | break | the grip of foreign oil 
a chance | to study | both of these plans 
a plan | to do | anything 
Mine | will do | neither one 
a chance | to brief or speak | these two presidential candidates 
an opportunity | to talk | both of both of them 
the message | 're going to give | Senator Obama 
the same message | will be | the same message 
the way | see | BLITZER : And when you speak to them , what will be the first thing , the most important thing , the message you 're going to give Senator Obama and I assume it will be the same message for Senator McCain ? 
they | would ask | the questions of me 
General Motors | makes | 19 vehicles 
They | are | South America 
the Russian oil company | announced | they 
the Iranians | announced | two weeks 
the time | has come | natural gas 
the Iranians | are switching | gasoline 
natural gas | selling | the oil 
a tough mission ahead of you | works | the U.S. 
the $ 700 billion | down | $ 200 billion 
40 percent of her six years in the Senate | down | in 10 years 
we | would have | the money 
profit | would be made | taxes 
We | would n't have | that huge outflow of money
