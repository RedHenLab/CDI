Joe Lieberman | be | a good pick 
he | was | Gore's ticket 
McCain | to put | an Independent 
Gore | thought | Gore 's 
ph | tags | Lieberman 
a family of 20 illegal aliens | can then vote | the ticket 
Hawesville | would be | McCain's best interests 
McCain-Lieberman | has been | my improbable dream ticket 
A campaign | to elect | two fiercely independent leaders 
Whatever | gains | McCain 
the center | choosing | Lieberman 
his V.P. | would be | the losses 
a great way | to ensure | an Obama victory 
a McCain-Lieberman ticket | would remind | me 
look | yours
