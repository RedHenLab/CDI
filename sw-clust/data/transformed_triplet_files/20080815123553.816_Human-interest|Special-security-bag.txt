Homeland Security correspondent Jeanne Meserve | is | Reagan National Airport 
We | do n't often have | a good news story 
the one-third of travelers | fly | a laptop 
laptops | out | the security check point 
a zipper | opens up | a clam shell 
they | can get | a clean look 
a clean look | is still | the bag 
less time | spent putting | things 
the bin | putting | things 
fewer computers | accidentally abandoned | screeners owners 
They | grab | their owners bags 
they | forget | their owners laptops 
we | talked to love | the new cases 
This one | designed | a company 
someone | travels | a laptop 
a laptop | might be | the investment
