we | want to bring | two of the political contributors 
Let | start | by 
We | 've seen | the Georgian president talk 
they | 're taking | a little bit of the focus and thunder 
a | handle | this situation 
he | is | charge 
he | 's | charge 
the actions | described suggest | the president 
they | 're | the right actions 
Putin | wants | a major confrontation 
He | wanted | further 
he | wants | further 
The only question | had is | how come 
we | did n't see | this coming 
John McCain | did see | this coming 
He | 's been talking | this sort of thing 
Puty | put | our Republican president 
the president | was sitting next | our president 
we | want | a continuation of these polities 
John McCain | will offer | JOHN MCCAIN -LRB- R-AZ -RRB- 
a continuation of these polities | is up | Senator Obama 
he | reassert | economic power 
Putin | knows | we 
he | 's acting | will 
we | need to | this election talk 
we | can assert | American influence 
a country | sitting next | our president 
the eye of Democrats towards President Bush | 's stretching | BENNETT : What everyone says about President Bush , whatever the eye of Democrats towards President Bush , it 's stretching it , I think , a bit to believe that Barack Obama would be stronger , more aggressive with the Putin than a John McCain would be . 
a bit | to believe | Barack Obama 
McCain | has had | this record 
this record for a very long time | comes | Putin 
He | is | vacation 
He | is | Hawaii 
He | has issued | some statements 
he | winning or losing | the perception 
he | is when | Hawaiian 
out | was | the CIA 
the president of the country | invading | country 
my CIA | had n't told | me 
Senator Obama | needs to talk | very 
our invasion of Iraq | is causing | energy prices 
which | is giving | Putin enormous economic power 
the Bush administration | is really | a little ridiculous 
Obama | reacted | a way 
which | asked | James about 
Georgia | to get | NATO 
he | continues to move | Tbilisi 
John McCain | calling | something 
stinger missiles and javelins | to be sent | the Georgians 
we | did | Afghanistan 
a stronger response | ignites | more violence 
a need | to send | a very unambiguous message 
Ukraine | is waiting | the wings 
they | do | Again 
America's | got to regain | its economic power 
America 's | 's got to get | its army 
America 's | do | America 's 
What kind of leverage | do | they 
the deficit | 's exploded | this administration 
Iraq | get | the Russian troops 
Putin | knows where | our army 
a question | was put | the administration 
We | heard | Secretary Rice 
we | 're | Georgia 
McCain's responses | would be | any different 
they | be | any different 
Russia | has invaded | this democratic country 
military policies | have sort of allowed | Putin 
We | need to get | our intelligence services 
which | has | this administration 
time | to change | things 
We | resent | these arguments 
time | to change | years of failed diplomatic , economic policies 
Democratic strategist James Carville | is clearly | what Senator Obama's 
they | are seen | the Russians 
the Russians | 're going to help | the Georgian people 
the Afghans | would be | an excellent thing 
we | have not heard | Obama 
somebody | believes | they 
people | ought to be | years 
responsibility and accountability | are | order 
Senator Obama | should point | -LRB- END VIDEOTAPE -RRB- MALVEAUX : Some fear the crisis in Georgia may be just the beginning and that Russia may have other plans , including some Washington might consider to be very ominous possibilities .
