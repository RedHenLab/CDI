We | have to make | the case 
We | share | one vision 
We | 're back | the best political team 
Senator Hillary saying Democrats | have to unite | Barack Obama 
she | was | good today 
the past | seemed | Hillary 
they | told | me 
kind | speaking | the heart 
she | 's doing | the best 
that her supporters | need | a catharsis 
a little | 're going to say | those things 
a catharsis | takes | some time 
Bill Clinton | has n't helped | Tara this week 
some of Tara supporters | are having | a harder time 
she | has been | forcefully supportive of Obama 
she | 's really given | the same kind of passion 
she | gave | Tara campaign 
she | has | this one core group of diehards 
they | believe | she 
she | needs | this opportunity 
the convention | to have | a roll call 
she | said | private
