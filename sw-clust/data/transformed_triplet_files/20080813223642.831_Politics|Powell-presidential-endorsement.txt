he | may endorse | one of the presidential candidates 
Powell | might endorse | Barack Obama 
a Fox News contributor | says | he 
Colin Powell | will endorse | Barack Obama and most likely 
ABC | caught | General Powell 
he | 's not going | the Democratic Convention 
He | did not let | the conversation 
he | endorse | anybody 
he | has not made | his mind 
He | served | the Bush administration 
He | 's been | a friend of John McCain 
One of these sources | told | me 
he | would like to vote | John McCain 
he | has n't found | a reason 
The second source | said | he 
Colin Powell | voted | Barack Obama 
Colin Powell | told | both candidates 
he | 's waiting | the V.P. picks 
He | likes | drama 
he | will not be going | the Democratic Convention 
the McCain people | asked | John McCain 
the Obama people | would love | Colin Powell 
They | would love | Barack Obama 
the Democratic National Convention | would disprove | something McCain 
Barack Obama | could get | a prominent Republican 
the Bush administration | would help | Barack Obama 
He | has | a lot of Republican friends 
the Democratic Convention | do | something 
General Powell | likes | the drama 
He | keeps | his cards 
he | is inclined to vote | Barack Obama 
Colin Powell 's and | will he make | an endorsement 
the McCain people | continue to lobby | a bit 
they | saw | those reports 
We | enjoy | the drama 
We | want to go back | our team 
just | to get | quick reaction 
We | know | Hillary Clinton 
she | have | an ulterior motive 
we | want to get back | the best political team 
John King 's point | would be | a great get 
an August surprise | would not be | a surprise 
now | has n't said | a word 
they | 're | all waiting
