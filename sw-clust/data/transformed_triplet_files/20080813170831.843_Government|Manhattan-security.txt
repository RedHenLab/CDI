KEILAR | would n't be | a fortress 
New York | are proposing | a special security zone 
checkpoints | heightened | screening 
Our Mary Snow | is | New York 
Ground Zero | also expanding | the rest of Manhattan 
they | are taking | New York 
A big part of this program | calls | photograph vehicles 
license plates | storing | those images 
nearly two dozen bridges and tunnels | funnel | the island of Manhattan 
The plan | would be | those tracking systems 
rings of radiation detection equipment | placed | the city 
we | have | a hit 
radiation material | is coming | the city 
the system | will know | the system 
We | have also distributed | thousands of radiation detectors 
all of this | will take | years 
some of this | is already | place 
the city | expects to have | a command center 
downtown Manhattan | will be keeping | tabs on thousands of surveillance cameras 
lower Manhattan | will all be feeding | one source
