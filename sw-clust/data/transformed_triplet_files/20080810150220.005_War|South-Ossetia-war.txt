Matthew Chance | has just returned | the front lines 
the Georgian forces | have been locked | close combat 
fierce | fighting | Russian forces 
that breakaway Georgian region of South Ossetia | have now disengaged | they 
the latest | comes | a result of an intense bombardment 
an overwhelming force of Russian troops | are deployed | Ossetia 
the Georgians | have said | the other reasons 
a cease-fire | to take | place 
Russian troops forces | have stopped fighting | the Russians 
Ossetia | has n't been | any response 
we | heard | some kind of explosions 
the course of the day | have been | attacks 
Russian warplanes | striking | targets 
violence | being reported | another separatist area of Georgia as well 
which | is also backed | Moscow 
Fierce | fighting | way 
separatist rebels | are backed | the Russian forces 
Fierce fighting under way there as well with separatist rebels who are backed by the Russian forces , fighting now against Georgians in their positions in that breakaway territory . | continues | its conflict 
We | 're going to be discussing | this and getting 
military infrastructure | to prevent | Georgian aircraft 
which | is relatively far away | the front lines 
we | are striking | legitimate military targets 
President Bush | issued | a statement 
we | are trying to enforce | the adventurous Georgian leadership 
he | should be held | the barbaric and treacherous attack 
he | should be held | the aggression 
his troops | sign | a legally binding agreement 
no ways | do we have | plans 
Georgian special forces | were throwing | grenades 
wounded civilians | including | little kids and peacekeepers 
no talk of South Ossetia | remaining | Georgia 
the people | have voted | several times 
South Ossetia | being | part of Georgia 
fact | taking | military action 
blockades | involving | Russian vessels 
We | want to be | no military equipment 
abroad is | being shipped abroad | the zone of conflict 
We | want to force | the Georgian leadership 
we | see right now | the ground 
Mass mobilization | is still | way 
any and | existed | a few days 
he | should unconditionally withdraw | his troops 
We | heard | the Russian representative 
Let | 's get | the assessment 
we | should be | this response 
the part of Russia | is | whatever the level of violence 
number one | has to be condemned | the world 
We | can not just go out alone | this and talk and act 
We | do n't have | much impact 
We | 've got to stand | with European allies 
they | are condemning | this action 
those Russian ships | leave | that port 
Ukraine | decides | the Ukraine , as you mentioned 
Ukraine | has always claimed | Ukrainian territory 
which | had hoped to become | a NATO ally 
me | get | your assessment 
They | are clearly | the superpower 
Russia | seems less | a democracy 
the Russians | to show | some restraint 
my hope | would be | the U.N. Security council 
the world | could spin out | control 
The only person in all of the United States | would be | that request 
Russia | should be kicked out | the G-8 
we | 're | that point 
we | do need to recognize | Russia 
They | have | responsibilities of a superpower 
they | can not claim | they 
we | do need | to 
we | do need | a resolution 
Russia | should be kicked out | the G-8 
the Russians | escalates | our differences 
Russia | should be kicked out | the G-8 
he | would withdraw | idea 
we | 're going to continue | our coverage of this breaking story
