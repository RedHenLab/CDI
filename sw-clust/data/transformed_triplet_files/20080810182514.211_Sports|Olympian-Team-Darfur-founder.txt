Let | 's put | that question 
a visa | to see | the games 
me | skating | circles and tights 
trouble | believing | -LRB- NEWSBREAK -RRB- FOREMAN : I 'm Tom Foreman . 
me | happened | china 
a visa | was granted | July 1st 
the Chinese embassy | saying | the visa 
they | said | we 
We | have | more than 380 athletes 
we | have | 72 athletes 
our whole mission | is | try 
Darfur | try and advocate | more protection 
we | need to raise | information 
China's role | connected | the Chinese over the genocide in Darfur 
my role | going | the Olympics 
we | were arranging | the trip 
the thing | led | me 
the Olympics | being more | a sporting festival 
the idea of the Olympics | not being | a sporting festival 
we | have | common 
we | should get together | that spirit 
we | can have | better talks 
people | would surprised to hear | me 
a huge proponent | mixing | politics 
this global event | was founded | the premise 
the mere competition | be | a force 
a force | improving | human rights and humanity 
They | are founded to try and promote | these ideals 
about | to help | 2.5 million people 
something | being | an Olympic athlete 
these athletes | are going | this very weekend 
a tremendous amount of pride | to see | your flag 
The entire reason | got | Darfur activism and activism 
general | was | because my Olympic experience 
an athlete | was | Africa 
we | had | common 
the Olympics | seeded | my 
me | was | me 
they | deserve | same right 
so my progression | has gone | someone 
whose eyes | were opened | the Olympics 
thanks | having | me
