The candidates | hit | a new low 
the term flip-flop | can be fighting | words 
END VIDEO CLIP -RRB- ROBERTS : Jeanne Moos on how some people | does n't have to be | a candidate's Achilles heel 
We | 're talking | flip-flops 
Flip-floppers | are | the world 
The only person | has flip-flopped | this issue 
McCain | would want | me 
The once lowly flip-flops | have been upgraded | recent years 
The flip flop | peaked | a political weapon 
republicans | shook | republicans 
The time | was | politicizing right and left feet 
She | patented | the one-piece mold 
They | 're | they 
The voting | is already | way 
Obama | is leading | sales 
a guy | seems to wear | flip-flops 
their creator | flip | flopping 
they | saying | he 
some issues | think | we 
these | support | your candidate
