drinking water | came | the tail pipe of that car 
right now | was | a hydrogen-fueled car 
people | see | the water 
we | showed | ALI VELSHI 
everyone | asked | me 
just H2O | is coming out | tailpipes 
they | told | me 
The biggest obstacle | facing | these vehicles 
The biggest obstacle facing these vehicles though | ranges | about $ 2 
$ 9 | to produce | the amount of hydrogen 
cost | does come | as technology advances 
they | do | gas engines 
they | cost | about two times 
we | spoke | yesterday 
the time | see | these cars 
we | think | hydrogen 
people | back | the technology 
Poppy Harlow drinking out of a tail pipe of a car yesterday | is just | a gas car 
a fuel nozzle | connects securely | the car's tank 
we | spoke | though 
these vehicles | will be | public sale 
all | have | risks 
We | need to manage | these risks 
The safety of hydrogen | 's | any more or less safe 
NASA | uses | NASA 
NASA | does n't have to ship | the world 
hydrogen cars | are out there | today 
more than half | are | California 
The stations | wo n't come | people 
people | wo n't buy | the cars 
they | have | a place 
Regardless | could still be | about four to 10 years 
hydrogen-fueled cars | hit | the mass market 
ALI VELSHI | works | the right way 
Poppy Harlow drinking out of a tail pipe of a car yesterday | feels | a totally normal car
