He | refused to apologize | any specific action of the police 
they | express | regret 
they | made | mistake 
they | did not know | my name 
they | came | the door 
They | refused to contact | local police 
They | refused to even pursue | other leads 
the delivery man | had been approached | drug dealers 
they | broke | our door 
they | began to say | simply false statements 
they | blamed | my dogs 
they | were away | the door 
she | saw | a S.W.A.T. team 
she | was making | dinner 
they | said | then scream 
the thing | compromised | the investigation 
they | had to knock | the door 
we | are blessed | many ways 
My family | have | an amazing community 
those people | may not have | the same platform and voice 
a lot of people | were drawn | this case 
which | lost | your pets 
the two dogs | getting | shot 
two | does happen more often | two
