Russia | join | me 
State Rice today | declared | the United States 
large numbers of Russian troops | remain | Georgian territory 
a truce agreement | signed | both sides 
the United Nations | led | the negotiations 
the Russian government | responded | at least today 
the two events | want to be | my criticism 
This crisis | was | long anticipated 
President Clinton | sent | his deputy secretary of state Straub Tallman 
The United States | managed to calm | things 
the Bush administration | did | nothing 
Condoleezza Rice | made | one brief trip 
They | celebrated | democracy 
they | took | pro-active action 
They | sent | an emissary 
He | went | Tbilisi 
David | give | LOU DOBBS 
Bush | did | nothing 
the crisis | depended | the intervention of an American envoy 
Russia | was | the United States 
the real trigger | think was | the aspirations of Georgia 
NATO | become really | part of the west 
a way | to provoke | Georgia 
perhaps impetuous action | use | Georgia 
an excuse | to cross | the border 
let 's | leave | the perhaps 
they | crossed | the border 
more action | taken | the ambassador 
One | could do | the same 
the issue | is why | the world 
the European Union | find | some response 
The American government | supported | Georgia's application 
the Europeans | led | Germany 
international affairs of this sort | is when | the U.S. 
The U.S. | did not show | international coalition leadership 
He | said | we 
at least Sarkozy | took | action 
he | deserves | some credit 
the part of Russia | to reconstruct | the Soviet Union 
once | existed | 1991 
Russia | can simply have | its foot 
the throat of anybody | dares to try to pursue | independent policies 
The only way | 's | a question of one administration 
the Bush administrations | made | enough mistakes 
they | should n't be accusing | each other 
the part of the western nations | to enforce | decent values 
The Russians | have attacked | Ukraine 
American missile | shipped | Ukraine 
a western ally | will | turn 
We | are | a bad situation
