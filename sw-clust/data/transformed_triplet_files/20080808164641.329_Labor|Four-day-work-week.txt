we | 've been talking | huge Fannie Mae losses 
Let's | get right down | get 
we | would n't be doing | this show 
we | were talking | the governor of Utah 
one | cuts | on energy costs 
certain things | have to think | about 
Leigh Gallagher | does n't effect | just the people 
governments | are doing | different things 
Utah's | shutting | Fridays 
they | 're having | Monday 
Other governments | might be | a better way 
they | shut | the buildings 
They | do | heat 
an easy one | to relate | our viewers 
everybody | can think | the four-day workweek
