He | plays | an aging baseball story 
he | goes back | the game 
the nickname | try to get | the hall of fame 
They | were | fifth place 
fifth | going be | a home run 
The faster | throw | fifth 
The whole world | loves | me 
Bernie Mac | told | David Letterman 
He | said | he 
he | wanted to enjoy | his life 
he | would have probably retired | stand 
stand - up | was | a grind 
he | would ever stop | entertainment 
The disease | was | Cedric 
He | wanted to entertain | people 
a lot | heard | STEVE HARVEY : I mean , you know , Bernie was in your face . 
He | was | too big 
Bernie Mac | to tell | jokes 
Bernie Mac's family | is asking | donations 
death | has | a way 
somebody | will say | something 
D.L. HUGHLEY | struggling | stories 
he | loved | pets 
He | was | a man's man 
We | 'll love and miss | Bernie Mac
