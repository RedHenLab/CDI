Let | 's go | CNN's Brian Todd

he | 's spoken | English 
he | 's addressing | the Pakistani people 
Zawahri | is believed to speak | Arabic and English 
U.S. officials | had denied | reports 
Pakistan | is virtually being ruled | Washington 
today | are competing to appease and please | the modern day crusaders 
the White House | are working to destabilize | this nuclear capable nation 
CNN | could not independently verify | the authenticity of the tape 
which | was released | al Qaeda's propaganda arm 
A U.S. intelligence official | would n't comment | the authenticity 
The only other widely circulated image of Al Zawahri | speaking | English 
he | 's believed to be hiding | the border 
We | asked | the former head of the CIA unit 
We | have | a new membership

he | has compromised | Pakistan's integrity 
Pakistani officials | have long denied | any Americans
