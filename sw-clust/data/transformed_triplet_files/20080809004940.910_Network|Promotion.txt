a girl | reaches | the age 
she | can help | the house 
the mother | starts keeping | this girl 
That girl | begins missing | school 
a girl | s | education and self-sufficiency program 
We | take | girls 
They | learn how | perfect a skill 
they | make | sheets 
they | make | dolls 
they | make | any kind of household linens 
Half of the funds | goes back | girls who have already failed in school 
The remainder | goes | an education program 
We | do | the time 
They | are passing | school 
they | are opening | businesses 
we | have | seven girls 
they | run | everything 
s | are dotted | the t 
the best job | have ever had | my life
