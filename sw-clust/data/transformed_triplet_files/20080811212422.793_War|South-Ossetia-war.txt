Let | 's bring in | our Barbara Starr 
the president | was saying | the Pentagon 
other | ferrying | Georgian forces 
they | have done | the last couple of days 
we | have spoken | our military sources 
they | were not going to move | Georgia proper 
They | felt | they 
one | has to assume | President Bush 
some fresh intelligence | indicates | things 
the Russian intention | to possibly depose | the Georgian leader 
the Europeans | have indicated | they 
that airport | to bring | humanitarian supplies 
that airport | would make | that airport to bring in humanitarian supplies very tough 
let's | go | Ed Henry 
Have | heard | Have you 
Barbara | had | this from the North Lawn of the White House -- Ed , very tough talk 
the president | used | that phrase 
that word brutal there | is | the 21st century 
the fact | looks more | the old Soviet Union 
Vladimir Putin | has vented | the United States 
White House officials | have counseled | me 
We | know | Putin 
We | 'll let | White House officials 
Russia on the world stage , show that they 're tough | blows | over 
he | wants | such a resolution 
the court of public opinion | decide | Russia's actions 
The U.S. | has | some intelligence 
consultations | were scheduled | the United Nations Security Council 
the world | would seem to be | the strategic approach 
they | 're going to take | the Security Council 
the other permanent members of the U.N. Security Council | to see and put | more pressure 
dramatic and brutal escalation | hinting | the U.S. feeling 
we | said | just a moment 
we | had heard | Georgian officials 
Tbilisi | had taken | place 
he | was actually holding | a conference call 
he | was brought | down 
They | piled | flak jackets 
Russian planes | were buzzing | the area 
President Mikhail Saakashvili , as you can see by this videotape , | being covered | his security forces 
They | 're putting | flak jackets 
unfounded there | was | no attack 
both | been | the area 
they | heard | explosions 
they | were | a result of aircraft dropping bombs 
they | were | incoming artillery 
any further escalation | could potentially seriously damage | U.S.-Russian relations 
Russians | may be moving | the capital of Tbilisi 
gotten reports | saying | Georgian troops 
capital | to make | the Russians 
the president | is going to be | this situation 
President Bush | to talk | that possibility of the capital 
Tbilisi | being taken | over 
the U.S. | is | Tbilisi being taken over 
we | 've gotten | these reports 
Those | suggest | the Russians 
Let | 's bring in | our Barbara Starr 
-LRB- BEGIN VIDEOTAPE -RRB- STARR -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Chaos in Gori as Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili is rushed away under heavy security . | comes to talk | military action 
the U.S. | have | any options 
We | have asked | a lot of questions 
one of the things officials | point | out 
the rest of the former Soviet east vaunt | is watching | this situation 
they | cast | Georgian officials lot 
the U.S. | can not do | anything 
the table | is how | all of those countries 
they | throw | Georgian officials lot 
the Russians | already had bombed | a military airfield 
The Russian military strategy | had begun to evolve | the last several hours 
All indications | appear to be | they 
something | is going | concern 
Tbilisi | comes | Russian bombardment 
thousands of other westerners | living | that city 
The strategy | getting | the Americans 
these convoys | assembling | the U.S. embassy 
The French | had made | some indications 
they | were going to try to take | perhaps thousands of other westerners people 
the Russians | make | perhaps thousands of other westerners moves 
the Russians | may be | the westerners 
We | do n't want to set | any alarm bells 
A convoy | is scheduled | tomorrow 
We | 'll see | that convoy 
the president | urging | Russia 
the terms of this cease fire agreement | 's been proposed | the European Union 
Georgian President Saakashvili | signed | the White House 
EU Envoys | are now | Moscow 
Moscow | to present | EU 
they | were to ignore | that and 
they | were to continue | their push 
they | might respond | Georgia proper 
they | 're hoping | they 
as Barbara | laid | out 
the pressure | is going to increase | this White House 
the Russians | were to take | the capital of Tbilisi 
Saakashvili | has been | the White House 
at least two or three times | recall | the White House at least two or three times 
his government | were to fall there | the U.S. 
Tensions | have already been | months
