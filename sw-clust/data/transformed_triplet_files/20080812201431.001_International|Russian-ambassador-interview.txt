We | 're following | breaking developments 
A potential | -LRB- | ph -RRB- cease-fire 
First | 's been reported | the Russian foreign minister 
we | think | he 
humanity | have been committed | which 
CHURKIN | would be | everybody 
we | can talk | the government of Georgia 
a position | to determine | others in the Georgian capital , other people with whom we can talk in the government of Georgia leadership 
we | are not determining | the leadership 
We | are expressing | our opinion 
our opinion | is | the people of Georgia 
Secretary Rice | said | earlier today 
President Medvedev | have given | orders 
our armed forces | to end | the peacemaking operation 
they | came | with six principles 
The Georgian forces | must go back | their initial bases 
Russian forces | will go back | the lines 
they | were | August 6th 
they | will be taking | measures 
will Russia | begin to pull | its tanks 
those ships | leave | the Black Sea 
they | pull out | South Ossetia 
they | go | the places 
they | can not relaunch | their assault 
we | must make | the Georgian government 
which | have been worked | the president of France 
he | is also presiding | the European Union now 
the ground | will be worked | a practical matter 
the Russian government officials | are speaking | to 
an order of the Russian president | to stop | the fighting 
up-to-the-minute information of what | is happening | the ground 
he | believes | Georgia 
He | said | specifically that 
Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili | was expected | unconditional support 
the West | had given | the last president of the Soviet Union , Mikhail Gorbachev , who essentially says that he believes that perhaps Georgia got a wink and a nod in terms of its own operation to move forward , a green light from the West 
reason | to think | he 
the United States | has had | a very close relationship 
we | are told | the United States 
he | started | this operation 
any signals | coming | the United States 
we | do not want to believe | the United States 
Mr. Saakashvili | to have behaved | such a reckless manner 
These actions | have substantially damaged | Russia's standing 
these actions | jeopardize | Russian relations 
we | have | a new reality 
a joint initiative | to resolve | the conflict 
we | hope | we 
the United States | to undermine | our relations 
we | might as well let | the United States deal 
we | work together | internationally 
we | have | equal interest 
we | should look and try to resolve | international and regional crises 
we | 've seen | Georgia 
we | hope | this thing 
We | are | the way 
your government | is going to do to follow | on that 
we | 're going to do | the things 
We | are going to talk frankly | But 
they | are going to draw | some conclusions 
The United States | has been | a major arms 
which | has also been | one of the arms suppliers 
we | hope | the United States 
Mr. Saakashvili | may have made | some tactical mistakes 
He | deserve | a more serious assessment of what 
he | has done | terms of war crimes
