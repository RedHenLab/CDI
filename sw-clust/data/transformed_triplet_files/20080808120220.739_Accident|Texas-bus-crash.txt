critical patients | are also | our ICU units 
a large amount of people | coming | your emergency room 
much time | have to prepare | these patients 
Harris Methodist Hospital in Forth Worth | goes down | the scanner 
we | get | all our staff 
they | 're here | a pretty short period of time 
we | were fully staffed | the ER 
We | called | in additional staff 
We | called | a lot of our surgeons 
a lot of our surgeons | is | that many patients 
we | had | quite a few individuals 
Any of those fatalities | occurring | your hospital 
We | have not had | any fatalities
