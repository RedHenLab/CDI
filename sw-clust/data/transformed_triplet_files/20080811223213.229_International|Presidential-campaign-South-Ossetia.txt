Barack Obama | issued | a written statement 
Russia | sounding | a bit 
We | 're just getting | an on-camera statement 
Let | 's bring back | CNN's Ed Henry 
this conflict | presents | a political opportunity 
people | to believe | he 
John McCain | is trying to seize | this issue 
John McCain | tried | showcase 
our allies | should continue | efforts 
the United Nations Security Council | condemning | Russian aggression 
Barack Obama | vacationing | Hawaii 
McCain | has | the stage 
he | has | the experience 
a crisis | claim | he 
he | started denouncing | Russian leader Vladimir Putin's anti-democratic moves 
We | must remind | Russia's leaders 
part of the civilized world | require | Russia 's leaders respect 
Obama | has been getting | briefings 
Georgia | spoke | out 
all sides | to show | restraint 
the 3:00 a.m. ad Hillary Clinton | ran | the Democratic primaries 
Obama | was up | the job 
The ad | did n't work | Clinton 
the McCain camp | thinks | the issue 
Independent voters | concerned | security 
McCain's claim | to have | a 
more | to handle | an unforeseen crisis 
Fifty percent | said | John McCain 
one | might expect | because all of the time 
we | have just gotten | a videotaped statement 
He | is vacationing | the island of Oahu 
He | is | Kailua 
We | got | the tape 
this aggression | seeking | a peaceful resolution 
We | should continue to push | a United Nations Security Council resolution 
The U.N. | must stand | the sovereignty of its members 
They | 're | all part of the best political team 
Let | start | with Georgia 
they | 've rung | one of these presidential candidates , they 
they | do | anything 
They | 're | commander-in-chief 
They | 're | two senators 
all right | running to be | commander-in-chief 
a lot anybody can do | includes | President Bush 
We | do n't have | a military 
We | do n't have | the moral high ground 
its members | invading | the sovereign borders of another nation 
we | did | Iraq five-and-a-half years 
they | may or may not draft | some sort of a resolution 
the Russians | do n't like | Russia 's 
they | 'll veto | Russia 's 
They | 're | a permanent member of the Security Council 
they | have | veto power 
the West | is going to do | a hell of a lot 
Senator McCain | is suggesting | Russia 
Senator Barack Obama | has said | he 
he | is talking | a little 
the upper hand | comes | Russia policy 
McCain | has | the upper hand 
he | 's been talking | for not only months 
He | knows | the players 
he | mispronounces | names 
He | knows | the players 
he | put | Friday 
even those of us | have been | Vladimir Putin 
those reporters | were traveling | McCain 
sort of | got | a kick 
he | recycles | this joke 
he | means | the statement that he put out on Friday , which was quick to condemn the Russians in the aggression and , you know , support the Georgians 
he | was ahead | the curve 
we | had | Paul Begala 
a week | could play | advantage 
time and place | means | everything 
we | had | more 
he | was | Santa Barbara 
vacation | have | something 
John McCain | coming out | he 
we | should do | this and

he | comes | his sweats 
Senator Barack Obama | was | he
