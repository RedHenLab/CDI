China | wants to head | the Chinese gulag

a way | to justify | its 
The argument | did | the revolution 
a residue of that | to exploit | this very deep aquifer of sentiment 
which | can serve | its purposes 
they | 're still trying to join | the world 
opposite things | are | the same time 
the nationalism | is | a worry 
China | is | terms of its government's ability 
the Olympics | gives | China 
a chance | to show how | its government 
terms | building | things 
the Olympic | is | the sense

your book | has had | the two countries 
China | was writing | this book 
the Americans | would say | me 
every single Chinese colleague | said | me 
the reaction to your book | indicates | the reaction to your book 
we | have | this enormous capability 
China | to underestimate | their problems

countries | are embracing | China's model 
the Chinese | have | the most satisfied country 
they | thought | the world thought of China 
they | have | a real brand problem 
the Chinese people | do not know how | the world 
the Chinese media | is still tightly controlled | the government 
we | should look | the screen 
the astounding thing | to | me

institutions | laid | down 
those of us | follow | the astounding thing to me 
China | will look | China 
China | starts | the Olympics 
They | tried to get | the 2000 Olympics 
this a kind | coming | party 
they | see | Jonathan Spence 
They | were bitterly disappointed | the failure 
they | saw | suitably millennarian 
they | felt | that was kind 
they | lost | the chance 
they | think | the United States 
one of the countries | rooted | -LRB- ph -RRB- 
They | felt | the way 
they | charged | any particular person 
They | felt | the record 
they | 'd over-advertised | advance 
the whole city | was festooned | things 
we | understood | China 
China | is just beginning | really 
we | have n't seen | anything 
loads | go right up | the air 
this whole load | teetering | the car 
they | have n't really faced | all the other environmental and practical sides 
families | move | two cars 
the space | is eaten | the speed of the car 
people | wonder | about 
they | watch | the Olympics 
this mean | have | 1.3 billion 
a country | will see | a great deal of nationalism 
we | will see | a great deal of national pride and prickliness 
the Catholic | missionaries | quite a bit 
they | got | China 
they | learn | Cantonese 
they | learn | Shanghai dialect 
they | learn | Beijing 
they | learn | western dialect 
different religious groups | made | different decisions 
itself | was | a bond 
the writing system | means | China's written language 
everybody | could read | the same texts 
they | could n't pronounce | different religious groups 
European countries | grew | power 
that nationalism | was often directed | outsiders 
the nationalism | was sort of directed | the foreigner 
Chinese nationalism | directed | people 
Jonathan Spence | could also be | Japan 
Jonathan Spence | tries to think | its options 
people | could argue | the people in the tribal areas 
the foreigners | had | real grievances 
Chinese unwillingness | to have | the same sense of ethical values 
the way | is | Greek and Roman 
a lot | goes | canniness 
the Chinese | read | their favorite novels 
the excitement | clashing | groups 
They | 're | the head 
They | 're tricking | the enemy 
They | 're luring | the enemy 
themselves | lead | ideas 
that certain kinds of sport | need | different kinds of skill and subtlety 
China | will be | a perfect example of borrowing 
they | are going to get | a great many medals 
we | did n't spend | so much time 
the public | likes | so much time 
they | want to build | the tallest building 
boast | passing | these metrics

sort of try | to see | some of this
