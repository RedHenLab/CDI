modern China | would mean | a brazen switch-a-roo 
Games organizers | confirmed | CNN 
Young's voice | was used | another little girl 
Lin Miaoke | was mouthing | the words 
China flag | entered | the stadium 
musical director | explained why | Beijing radio 
The reason | was | the national interest 
camera | should be | image 
We | had to do | the high court 's decision 
We | had been | several inspections 
they | 're | all very strict 
we | rehearsed | the spot 
Few | realize | Lin 
Tiny singer | wins | the heart of nation 
Lin Miaoke | might only be | nine years 
she | is already well | her way 
a star | thanks | her heart warming performance 
she | sang | a note
