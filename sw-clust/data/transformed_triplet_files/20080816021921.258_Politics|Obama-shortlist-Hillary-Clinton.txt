an or ticket | going | the road 
Obama | won | the primary battle 
he | 's been trying to woo | Clinton supporters 
A big step | is going to come later | this month 
Clinton's name | will be put | nomination 
Our latest Research Corporation poll | shows | voters 
a solid | win | over 
Obama | beats | McCain 
No wonder speculation | continues | the two top Dems 
many | remain | 360 's Tom Foreman reports . 
he | might pull | Eighteen million voters 
Bill and Hillary Clinton | could bring around | the voters 
Either way | figure | a final plus : Like the old saying 
Senator Obama | might want | Senator Clinton 
that Obama | fears | he 
Senators Barack Obama | could be seen | a signal 
a co-presidency | is | the offing 
Obama | ran so strongly | the message 
we | do n't change | course 
he | attacked | Hillary Clinton 
his ticket | could alienate | his own base 
a ticket | 's been | said plenty 
Obama | had | a hard enough time 
three | would be | a crowd 
Bill Clinton | offers | way 
too much baggage | to give | Hillary Clinton 
The guessing game | has gone | months 
Democrats | will find | out 
their dream team | remains | just a dream 
Tom Foreman | discussed | his piece 
the ticket | could give | Obama 
reason | enough to seriously consider | Hillary 
we | look back | polling 
we | see | any person 
they | announce | their vice presidential candidate 
They | get | a kind of roll 
this sort | goes back | my earlier point 
the Obama campaign | thinks | the Obama campaign 
they | need | some sort of steak 
what Obama | wants | this ticket 
they | are qualified to be | president 
they | help | the candidate 
Hillary Clinton | seems to take | care of both 
she | 's not perceived to be | the short list 
Pennsylvania | make | a big , big difference 
she | would make | a big difference 
they | 're actually farther | McCain 
Kerry | was | 2004 
They | 're doing better | past Democrats 
women real problem | is | white males 
they | do n't think | Hillary 
they | do n't think | she 
somebody else | might do | a better job 
they | 're | she 
she | does n't represent | change 
plenty of presidents | have picked | vice presidents 
whom | -- | whom 
they | had | blood 
they | have done | plenty of presidents 
they | needed | the person 
They | 're not feeling | pressure 
they | need to pick | someone 
they | do n't want to pick | But , when -- they have done it when thought they needed the person to absolutely win , or when they were pressured into doing it for some reason 
Bill Clinton | is back | the White House 
Barack Obama | to govern | her and husband 
Bill Clinton | does factor | all of this 
he | factors hugely | Candy 's 
Bill Clinton | was asked | ABC 
Barack Obama | is qualified to be | president 
he | ca n't help | himself 
they | do n't see | that happening 
that happening | 's been | a big disqualifier
