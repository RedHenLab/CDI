the banter | goes back and forth | VP picks and people 
the Christian conservatives | saying | we 
a Tom Ridge | is | a pick 
the youth circles | would be | a great choice 
McCain | to help energize | more young people 
Jason | should n't be | Liebermann 
We | need | someone 
everyone | knows | McCain 
his conservative base | going | the primary process 
Mitt Romney | would be | a good choice 
Tim Pawlenty | would be | an excellent choice 
Those two | have n't had | any speaking spots 
John McCain | picks to be | his VP 
John McCain | has | a real problem 
he | needs to shore | his conservative base 
his conservative base going through the primary process and his career | 's necessarily | something 
the swing | voters | he 
he | trails | this election 
Mitt Romney | would both be | good candidates 
they | do appeal | those swing voters 
they | 're necessarily | strong base vote 
he | 's got | a real problem 
he | want to pander | the base 
he | want to try to win | this election 
Barack Obama | has | a plethora of good choices 
Barack Obama | has | a decision 
Barack Obama | is whether or not | a decision to make too when it comes to this 
some experience | to help back | Barack Obama 
Which direction | do you think | he 
We | can have | a candidate 
we | 'll have | someone 
a number of governors | bring | some great roots 
his country | would help even | Barack Obama 
we | have | foreign policy experts 
whose names | are being tossed | around 
he | does pick | his vice president nomination 
We | 're going to have | a very strong unified ticket 
they | have | more experience 
we | 'll have | both of you
