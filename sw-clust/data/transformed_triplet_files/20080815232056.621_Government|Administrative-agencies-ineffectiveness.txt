we | have been told | a federal government department or agency 
a federal government department | ca n't do | its job 
a federal government department | is just | too much work 
the toxic toy | recalls | the past year 
ph | said | the millions of tons 
we | can not inspect | our way 
another agency | ca n't fulfill | its responsibilities 
today | admitted | the salmonella outbreak 
which | is now | its fourth month 
Time | ca n't explain why | so many Americans 
Time | took | the FDA more 
the FDA | to finally admit | the cause of the outbreak 
the origin of the outbreak | was | Mexico 
We | should point | this broadcast 
the first | to report | that fact 
we | are told | is 30 
40 people | are | every one
