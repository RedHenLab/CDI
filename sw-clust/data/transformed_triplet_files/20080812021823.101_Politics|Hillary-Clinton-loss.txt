we | saw | a distinction 
they | are | states 
Howard Wolfson | starts talking | the working-class voters 
he | 's thinking | we 
we | 're | Ohio and Pennsylvania 
He | 's not talking | Iowa 
Iowa | would have worked | Hillary Clinton 
Wolfson | suggested | campaigns 
no one | would have been | Hillary Clinton 
history | includes | her husband's impeachment process 
we | would have gotten | the votes 
the Hillary campaign | did | Gore 
They | 're trying to get | Clinton
