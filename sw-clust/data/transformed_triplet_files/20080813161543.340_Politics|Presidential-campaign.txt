Denver | is where | we 
of | liked | Tom Foreman 
We | 're | Sturgis 
John McCain | is going to be | campaigning 
they | start talking | the economy 
we | had | a little bit of difficulty 
we | 're hearing | people 
A lot of talk | travel | these battleground 
the outsourcing of American jobs | is still not | the satisfaction of many voters 
they | 're going to do | about this 
they | 're being told | the national economy 
we | 're living | the national economy 
we | 're seeing | the problems 
we | 're seeing | the problems 
we | 're seeing | the problems 
They | want | some more concrete answers 
whichever candidate | gets | those answers 
they | get | a lot of the undecided voters 
a good sense of this | talk | people 
one | is worried | the economy 
they | like | one candidate 
that case | could seem | the average person 
which candidate | represents | people 
Do people | seem | people 
they | seem to be leaning | one direction 
a lot of people | seem squishy | people decision 
the primary reason | get | people 
they | do n't feel | they 
They | feel | the candidates 
themselves | to politically say | the right thing 
They | know | the candidates 
they | will lose | some votes 
they | 're saying | we 
he | will make | a clear answer from these candidates about what they are going to do 
they | think | we
