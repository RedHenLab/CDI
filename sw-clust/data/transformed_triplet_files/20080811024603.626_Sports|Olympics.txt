Henry Kissinger | took | a nap 
Phelps | had just won | Olympic gold 
Team U.S.A. | put | a show today 
Master class | to match | the importance of the biggest basketball game 
back-to-back slams | added | the 31-point victory 
the score | was | the spectacle 
A record TV audience | to watch | a rout
