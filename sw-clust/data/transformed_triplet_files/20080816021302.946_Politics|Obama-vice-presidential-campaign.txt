my final counselor | 'm making | decisions 
the only ones | being vetted | a process 
the short list | to keep | mind 
some | think | Obama 
he | allay | whatever the perceived weaknesses are of Obama 
he | has | a background 
he | made | an interesting run 
they | want to bring | some different kind of energy 
We | will know when | he 
a lot of people | think | he 
Does Obama | seem threatening | some independents 
Does Obama | seem | foreign policy 
he | seems | the second man 
he | is | the people 
He | knows | his way 
they | seem to be | very intent 
he | is really | a mainstream kind of guy 
they | think | they 
they | do n't want to do | anything 
any vice president | gives | a bounce 
a bounce | is | Obama 
they | 're not vetting | a whole lot of people 
they | are trying to figure | the odds
