a town | has | too much oil 
The vast beauty of Alaska's Prince William Sound | is more | 4,000 miles 
the catch | has n't been | the same since 
1994 | ordered | the company 
n't no justice | left | this country 
MATTINGLY | -LRB- | camera -RRB- 
these docks | used to be | activity 
these docks | have become | one big silent parking lot 
Prince William Sound | might look | pristine 
We | took | a float plane 
an island | inundated | the '89 spill 
a shovel | to find | that oil 
MATTINGLY | -LRB- | camera -RRB- 
that Supreme Court ruling | said | me 
Exxon | gave | The residents 
we | lost | an average of $ 50,000 
We | paid | $ 300,000 
We | had to sell | our permit 
they | think | they 
frustration rises | falls | the tide 
Exxon Mobil | called | the Valdez 
a tragic accident | said | the company 
they | will forever remember | the spill 
they | do get | some money 
Alaskans | get | money 
Alaskans | is always | this battle 
We | need | more oil
