we | find | CNN's Frederik Pleitgen 
things | stand right now | the government 
we | were hearing | those reports 
troop transporters | was actually | the road 
we | were talking | the Georgian officials 
they | seemed to be | the Georgian officials 
he | believes | the Russians 
the terms of that cease-fire agreement | is supposed to be | place 
both sides | to end | hostilities 
they | do n't believe | they 
they | were only using | tank column 
a military base | to demilitarize | a zone 
something | is | the Georgian government 
they | believe | Russia's ultimate aim 
someone | can offer | some clarity 
He | seems to have | very few cards 
Frederik Pleitgen | is certainly | something 
he | did n't always play | his cards 
he | might have miscalculated | some of the reactions 
he | has n't softened | his rhetoric 
He | 's still hurling | accusations 
He | is saying | the Russians 
very strong words | coming | the Georgian president 
he | 's also saying | his country 
Russian troops | to enter | the city 
the people of this country | would fight | every drop of blood 
the rhetoric | coming here | Georgia 
We | are keeping | our eyes 
we | have gotten | the two-minute warning 
his comments | regarding | the situation 
Josh Levs | is standing | the international desk 
not everybody | understands where | we 
this country | is basically | the size of South Carolina 
we | 're seeing | today 
we | 'll pull | in time 
Let 's | listen | the president
