We | have | some more classic material 
another example of Bernie | directly addressing | the audience 
That what | 'm going to do | those kids 
Talk | be | me 
They | 're too grown | today 
Bernie Mac | beat | his kids 
Bernie Mac | revealed | he 
an issue | was | an issue 
He | was | a trooper 
he | would always conquer | anything 
Bernie | was | a father figure 
He | stressed | hard work and humility 
he | acted | he 
He | taught | me 
many things | learned | DEE DEE DAVIS 
all | going | the memorial service 
all | spending | these moments
