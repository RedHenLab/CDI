Russia and Georgia | may be | ever 
Russian troops | have ignored | the truce 
They | wanted to split | Georgia 
The president of France | helped brokered | the cease-fire 
the European Union | can send | peacekeepers 
Part of the mission | would focus | humanitarian aid 
we | did have | those reports 
troop personnel carriers | moving | this city 
The Georgian president | was | CNN 
he | said | he 
he | had to say here | CNN 
the Russians | are encroaching | the capital 
They | 're making | the circle 
they | 're brushing | their plan 
Their plan | was to help establish | their own government 
their plan | was to kill | our democracy 
they | 're | the process of cold-blooded murder 
the Russians of course | are denying | those allegations 
they | felt threatened | the Georgian Army which 
long | abandoned | area 
we | 're getting | further reports 
They | are saying | they 
Georgia | telling | me 
he | has heard | reports 
that area | have been | looting 
violence | going | that town of Gori 
We | will certainly keep | our eye 
Frederik Pleitgen | coming | `` irregular fighters '' in that area
