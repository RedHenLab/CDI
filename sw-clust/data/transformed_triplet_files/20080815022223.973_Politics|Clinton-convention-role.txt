Hillary Clinton | putting | the question of what 
Her name | will be put | a roll call vote 
She | will encourage | her delegates 
his hand | forced | the Clintons 
one | would think | they 
they | wanted to put | a period 
they | have known | all 
they | watched | the past three months 
we | 're going to demonstrate | the streets 
We | 're not going to vote | the bubbling-up of people who have said 
her name | gets put | nomination 
her name in nomination | seems | both sides 
those | are | politically astute as 
we | going to see | television 
they | go | each delegation 
the goal | having | a unified convention 
they | have not worked | the details 
Her name | will be put | nomination 
a good deal | solving | 37.2 percent 
one big happy family | working together | concert 
itself | strikes | me 
a deal | will provide | a cathartic moment 
Hillary Clinton | has been arguing | some time 
a deal | 's been | my understanding 
a deal | will not be | prime time 
Hillary | is going to have | a slot 
Bill | is going to have | a slot 
we | 're going to have | a roll call vote 
they | did n't seem to want | a few weeks 
they | have given | the appearance 
they | have given | the appearance 
they | will give | on 
they | would have been | a lot of better off 
they | believe | Obama 
we | seem to have | a problem 
they | fall | line 
he | be | a little giving and gracious and recognize 
She | has been warning | her people 
which | is designed to have | nothing 
200 people | can make | noise 
people | take away | a convention 
something | happens | the floor 
no one | expects | this point 
they | 're | just a few dead - enders 
Have | heard | term 
candy | thrown | Barack Obama
