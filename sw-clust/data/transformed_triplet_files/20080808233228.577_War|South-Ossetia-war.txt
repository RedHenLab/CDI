We | 'll examine | the risks 
Georgia tonight | is preparing to declare | martial law 
Russia | invaded | his country 
Russian tanks | crossed | the border 
Georgia | tried to gain | control of the breakaway region 
The Georgian president | accused | Russia of aggression 
Georgia | has | no interest 
We | are | a situation of self 
The United States | has called | an immediate cease 
Russia | end | its air and missile attacks 
Tensions | have been building | the area 
we | see | this rapid escalation 
basically the brink of war | is no longer | the brink of war 
the conflict | can be contained | the conflict 
Georgia | has tried to regain | territory 
Georgia | was | part of the Soviet Union 
those boundaries | were recognized | international boundaries 
one | wonders why | Russia 
President Bush | has been regularly updated | the situation 
the United States | supports | Georgia's territorial integrity 
we | call | an immediate cease-fire 
Americans | sitting | their TVs 
the U.S. involvement | is | a fairly low level 
The United States | has been training | the Georgian army 
the U.S. Army 's | may not be | the Russians 
only one road | leads | South Ossetia 
only one road that leads into South Ossetia , over the mountains from Russia | 's not going to be | a simple matter 
Russia | to move | troops 
the area where the Mexican military crossed last weekend | defeat | the Georgian army 
itself | will get involved | the conflict 
which of course | is | the Georgians 
they | are | stake 
Georgia | is | the really key problems 
Georgia | is | our backyard 
Georgia | is | our neighborhood 
the Georgians | consider | that Russia 
independent countries | have | the right 
their own future | make | their own decisions 
Georgia | has sought to join | NATO 
the failure | to begin | the process 
NATO | was | one of the things 
Russia | to act | SATTER : Well , it could be that the failure to begin the process of welcoming Georgia into NATO was one of the things that encouraged Russia to act as it has before Georgia makes too much progress in the direction of becoming part of the Western alliance and the costs of aggression would correspondingly increase . 
Georgia | makes | too much progress 
the direction | becoming | part of the Western alliance 
a comment | made | Georgia's president 
He | made | this comment 
an issue of a big country | trying to destroy | a small country 
the Soviet mentality | exists | Russia 
Russia | does n't recognize | Georgia 
which | should be | Russia 
the rest of the world | should go | such a distorted interpretation
