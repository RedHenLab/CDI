we | 've been following | last hour 
Russia | bombed | one of its provinces 
Georgian troops | shot down | two Russian aircrafts 
Russia | is fighting | war 
we | are | the situation of self-defense 
a country of less than 5 million people | certainly | our forces 
that Georgian troops | have shot | down two Russian aircrafts 
a very small part of the inflights | basically did n't change much | the picture 
one of these aircrafts | was specifically attacking | the civilian hospital 
the United States government | should do | anything 
the overall population | is | the -- right 
they | 've been amassing | troops 
they | made | no secret 
They | are | our closeness 
they | 're | Georgia's democracy 
they | 'd be shelling | our position 
we | declared | unilateral cease fire 
we | responded when | Russian tanks 
the very moment | got | the news Russian tanks

we | want to be | a democracy 
now | 's | Georgia 
the Pentagon | is following | these developments 
Georgia | have been there | sometime 
They | 've been doing | work 
many , many months | trying to train | Georgian forces 
The U.S. | has counted | heads 
They | believe | all U.S. military and Pentagon personnel 
They | are monitoring | the situation 
they | do n't yet see | any type of evacuation 
a request | would come | the State Department 
a country | see | aircrafts 
Barbara Starr | might be | the road 
the U.S. military | might have to send | some planes 
They | do n't think | they 
The Georgia president | said very flatly | we 
we | know yet | Russia 
Everyone | has | in somehow some response to some of the reporting that Russian peace keepers in Georgia have been killed own point of view 
we | have n't yet seen | a public response 
the U.S. military | has been there | some time 
Russia | is strictly | a training mission 
something | has not particularly sat well | Moscow 
the Pentagon | wants to stop seeing | people 
each other | does n't want to see | planes 
an escalation | 's | anybody 
some point today | continue to work | your sources 
Russia | has actually been | the separatist ambitions of some 
the Pentagon | has | a strong view 
these situations | becomes | very much a matter of international diplomacy 
these tensions | ratcheted | down 
Thanks | playing | we

Georgia | calls | ethnic cleansing 
the area | have made | their way north 
aerial bombardments and artillery attacks | have been conducted | the Georgian armed forces 
the international community | must stop turning | a blind eye 
the massive arms procurement | are being made | the Georgian state 
now | is also | U.S. ally 
now | 's been trying to upgrade | its military 
we | 're seeing | now underway 
very dramatic images of Russian tanks | moving | Georgia 
those tanks | are | their way 
the thousands of Russian peace keepers | are already | the ground 
we | 've heard | the Russian 
we | continue to look | those very images 
we | talk | about 
the near future | knocking | these tensions 
the parties | involved | this conflict 
Georgia | have very much been frozen | conflicts 
a solution | to resolve | all the problems 
no real suggestion | is just | the corner 
we | 're seeing | today 
a culmination of all the tensions | have been escalating | this part of the world 
We | will keep | close contact 
Georgia's president | is saying | the situation of his country 
the world | will be | trouble 
Russia | going to get | this kind of violation 
We | will have | more
