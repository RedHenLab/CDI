Tensions | are | the conflict 
Georgia's president | claims | one third of his country 
he | was awarded | the Nobel Peace Prize 
earlier this week | titled | The Path 
We | 'll get right | the Soviet Union 
The president of Georgia | told | CNN 
we | 've been witnessing | the past few days 
GORBACHEV | -LRB- | TRANSLATOR 
the situation | is | their side 
the situation | was | all 
the situation | was shelled | shells of enormous power 
They | used | artillery 
They | used | aircraft 
They | used | all weapons of killing 
they | were | the oldest 
GORBACHEV | -LRB- | TRANSLATOR -RRB- : Yes 
the response | required | the movement of additional forces 
Tskhinvali | was attacked | a powerful force 
he | calls | this regime change 
He | said | Russia's true objective 
GORBACHEV | -LRB- | TRANSLATOR -RRB- 
Russia | could not avoid addressing | this assault 
The peacekeepers | had been there | some time 
some dialogue | going | they 
Russia | 's happened | Russia 
Russia | invaded | Georgia 
a plan | to attack | Ossetia 
GORBACHEV | -LRB- | TRANSLATOR -RRB- 
they | are showing | the city 
now | is becoming | clearer 
Russia | plans to stay | Georgia 
GORBACHEV | -LRB- | TRANSLATOR -RRB- 
Russia | has | a mandate 
the president of Georgia | can no longer be | our partner 
GORBACHEV | -LRB- | TRANSLATOR -RRB- : Well 
people | are saying | what people 
Saakashvili | had misled | Europe 
He | misled | the United States 
unless | were to think | the United States 
Saakashvili | implemented | the United States 
as | regards | the peacekeeping contingent 
a person | does not deserve | trust 
GORBACHEV | -LRB- | TRANSLATOR -RRB- 
both | have | powers 
people | have known | each other 
no one | should expect | things 
our prime minister | was | Beijing 
The president | was taking | decisions 
they | 're beginning to show | some pictures of the destruction 
me | was | a well prepared project 
they | wanted to put | the blame 
a person | has | a moral right 
GORBACHEV | -LRB- | TRANSLATOR -RRB- 
that mutual affection | developed | centuries 
We | 'll be | President Mikhail Gorbachev 
the territorial integrity of Georgia | to be respected | the cease-fire agreement 
We | 're back | President Mikhail Gorbachev 
He | is | Moscow 
the world | is moving | a new cold war 
GORBACHEV | -LRB- | TRANSLATOR -RRB- : Well 
the world | 's been | some time 
two or three years | 's been | talk 
We | see | some things 
something | will be writing | a special article 
Weapons trade | is going on | a hectic pace 
Georgia | not been armed | the teeth 
A small state | has | a $ 1 billion military budget 
the United States | armed | Georgia 
Mountains of weapons | were supplied | Georgia 
we | have | time 
the United States | has made | mistakes 
the military budget of the United States | is | $ 600 billion 
we | need | a new agenda 
the ground | to sort | our relationship 
the guise | promoting | national interests 
we | see | situations 
Saakashvili | have mustered | the courage 
a situation | threatened | a clash 
we | see | the United States 
our two countries | to develop | a new agenda 
as | to promote | both U.S. and Russian interests 
the idea | creating | a bipartisan commission 
a good idea | will be | both of our countries 
GORBACHEV | -LRB- | TRANSLATOR 
all of us | continue | the same lines of mistakes and illusions 
we | should adjust | our policies 
we | should do | KING : Mr. President , where is all of this going ? 
we | do n't do | KING : Mr. President , where is all of this going ? 
KING : Mr. President , where is all of this going ? | could really cause | very severe complications 
The United States | should not think | the attempt 
The Washington Post | have seen | some of the more than 400 opinions 
people | are really seeing very clearly | the relationship 
We | 're almost | time 
Russia | to withdraw | Georgia 
GORBACHEV | -LRB- | TRANSLATOR 
Russia | does n't need | anything 
We | want | this nation 
we | have been living | 300 years 
We | do n't want | problems 
we | have | problems 
outside interference | pushes | things 
we | see | competition 
we | need to reestablish | trust 
we | have | individual steps 
we | worked together | a 
we | created | a new situation 
We | created | trust 
we | started to eliminate | nuclear weapons 
We | started to reduce | conventional weapons 
We | opened | the way 
most of the regional conflicts | were settled | that time 
GORBACHEV | -LRB- | TRANSLATOR -RRB- 
We | welcome | LARRY KING 
Those people | come | the Orwellian world 
whom | had | lots of respect 
your show | basically vindicating | lies and deceptions 
the man | is justifying bringing | 1,200 Russian tanks 
more than they | ever brought | Afghanistan 
the KGB people | are doing right now | my country 
the man | has | Nobel Peace Prize 
the Nobel Peace Prize | is given | some 
things | perpetuating | peace 
the man | is justifying | crimes 
humanity | taking | place 
Human Rights Watch | reported | This is human rights report ... KING : OK ... SAAKASHVILI 
crimes | taking | place 
the guy | dealt | Reagan 
he | 's speaking | this way 
the man | brought | the Soviet Union 
he | said | the demise of the Soviet Union 
he | 's always thought | once Russia 
they | would have | more money 
they | would resuscitate | the Soviet Union 
he | was trying to do | my country 
Russia | has introduced | an all-out embargo 
Russia | 's | the first time 
they | have done | all kinds of provocation 
a media war | was | our desire 
a free society | to have | our freedom of choice 
first | was never | some region 
Russia | made | Russia 
they | wanted | regime change 
They | did | Russia 
They | tried to do | Russia

people | are going around | military fatigues 
we | get | different media outlets 
They | target | journalists 
They | target | people 
people | thrown | out 
incapacitated old people of these destroyed Georgian villages | are facing | desperate conditions 
they | talk | guilt 
The figure of people | killed given | the Russians 
any way | confirm | the Russian statistics 
they | suggest | the numbers 
they | are not lying just | fun 
which | constituted | these claims of genocide 
people | are there | the side 
She | 's making | a formal cease-fire agreement 
we | saw | they 
lots of people | when | Russian tanks 
they | come in and certainly | they 
we | have | very good contacts 
one thing | should be made | Russians 
their invasion | to legalize | their presence 
these people | are going to make | much more trouble 
we | should take | a closer
