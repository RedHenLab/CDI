Let | 's save | that question 
we | were | all surprised 
Senator McCain | do | something 
he | becomes | president 
Errol | knocks | the props 
we | 've heard | received wisdom 
We | 've heard | the United States 
the only superpower | left | the world 
We | heard | the whole point 
democracies | do n't make | war 
Russia | is behaving | a democracy 
we | will have | a long debate 
Georgia | 's | the kind of democracy 
most Americans | would recognize | or even 
Let | 's talk | democracies 
we | 'd see | a centralized state 
we | have | the European Union 
an impotent shadow | is quivering | fear 
they | 're | the verge 
they | 're | an impotent shadow 
They | 're clearly showing | they 
they | 're | gas 
the whole point of the post cold war world | was | sort of 
which | could n't have | nations 
Germany | ca | all of a sudden 
Germany | was supplying | 40 percent of you can argue about whether the EU is too strong or something like that natural gas 
Germany | ran | the other way 
we | had | lots of leverage 
we | could threaten to pull | loans 
We | do n't have | leverage

The roles | are actually reversed | Russia circa 
the nation | looks | all the world 
the verge | being | a debtor nation 
a crisis | complicated and deepened | oil 
the president | come home early | Beijing 
the Oval Office | have | a discussion 
We | have had | two presidential candidates 
one of whom | is | vacation 
two | is | Russia 
we | need | big ideas 
We | need | candidates 
we | will lead | the European Union 
We | will lead | the European Union 
We | 'll talk | the private arrogance and public arrogance of both Senator Obama 
European nations | have invested | Georgia 
whose | owe | the Georgians 
the coalition of the willing , | sent | the troops Iraq 
we | owe | Two thousand Georgian troops 
we | do not owe | Two thousand Georgian troops
