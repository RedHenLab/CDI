we | are back | a moment 
Let | take | a moment 
Let | 's go | a ride 
some of the mystery | surrounding | great white sharks 
we | do n't know | right 
we | do n't know | every day 
out | learn | something 
She | heads | a small island home 
the seals | attract | great white sharks 
only this morning | is still | the seals 
Allison | turns off | the motor 
we | witness | a remarkable spectacle 
Great whites | leaping | the sea 
The water | turns | blood 
each kill | noting | the time 
a shark | circles | our boat 
the shark | makes | its move 
the seal | escapes and uses | the boat 
its shadow | to confuse | the shark 
a nine-foot shark | circling | the boat 
some reason | 'm | the only one 
the shark | passes | the boat several times 
so little | is known | Great whites 
Allison | hopes to change | people's understanding of sharks 
She | 's tagging | great whites 
darts | attached | transmitters 
They | can then track | the shark's movements 
She | uses | a tuna head 
bait | to get | sharks 
three sharks | competing | this bait 
her team | can tag | the shark 
they | have to get | a clear photograph of its dorsal fin 
they | can identify | a clear photograph of its dorsal fin 
the shark | has to actually come | the water 
they | get | a clear photo 
they | need to lure | the shark 
the transmitter | can be shot | the base of the dorsal fin 
the transmitter | wo n't do | any permanent damage 
an organization | called | Save our Seas 
Allison | has tagged | more than 70 great whites 
the last five years | identified | more than 300 individuals 
Today | was | a good day 
our very own Anderson Cooper for some sharp tagging | was | a brilliant day 
She | is still | a long way 
the mysteries | surrounding | great whites 
they | give | birth 
she | hopes to learn | as much 
she | can and show | people 
they | 're | a unique species
