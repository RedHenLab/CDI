The Democratic Party | could well be headed | a showdown 
Obama and Clinton staffers today | agreeing to place | Senator Clinton's name 
a decision | not fully formed at least | terms of the public explanation 
Hillary supporters | are looking | catharsis 
We | do not want | any Democrat 
Clinton's name | will be placed | nomination 
her delegates | will have | the opportunity 
Clinton folks | put | a joint statement 
this which | makes it seem | they 
the vote | make | the party look 
Hillary Clinton's name | is called | she 
we | hear | some kind of a roll call 
we | have | Barack Obama supporters 
the Florida and Michigan delegations | have | Barack Obama supporters booing votes 
the superdelegates | hold fast | Obama Clinton 
the regular delegates | had | some sort of adult supervision 
Clinton | will have | the chance 
the stage | tell | all of her supporters 
me | make | the cracks 
the glass ceiling | is | our heads 
We | made | PRESTON

They | 're going to make | our Bill Schneider 
A lot of people | would say | nobody 
They | are not pledged to support | anybody 
They | can vote | any way 
They | 're clearly going to vote | Obama
