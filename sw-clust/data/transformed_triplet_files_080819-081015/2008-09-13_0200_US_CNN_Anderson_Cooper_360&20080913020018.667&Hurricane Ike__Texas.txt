us | to hit | Houston , more striking moments 
we | begin | the obvious 
you | see | them 
a new weather bulletin | expected | any moment 
you | do n't need | a bulletin 
who | should have gone | now 
Their lives | are | their own hands 
They | were being rescued | all day 
you | see | it 
conditions | got | the choppers 
the rescue workers | to risk | their own lives 
There | is | a crippled freighter 
That | is | a new development 
FEMA | estimating | $ 11.8 billion worth 
here | is | what everyone 
This | is | Galveston Island 
There | is | a picture 
us | begin tonight | Gary Tuchman 
We | 're obviously having | trouble 
You | can tell | they 
We | are going to try to get | their mike situation 
the western part of the outer eyewall | is now getting right | Galveston 
that | is | what 
they | see | all night 
they | may see | the eye 
The eye | is | only about 45 miles 
That | means | it 
That | means | this storm 
that | brings | her arms 
this | gets down | 30 miles 
the winds | could go up | that major category 
there | is | Galveston right 
they | 're right | the edge of this squall 
you | get | contact 
you | have got | them 
I | know | what 
This | is | the most dangerous part of the storm 
this | is going to work | its way 
it | is going to come back | us 
That | may be somewhere | La Porte 
I | saw | a gust 
that | is | what 
we | 're going to expect | a lot of the night 
those guys | are probably going to get | 80 or 90 
I | hope | we 
they | 're | water 
They | 're | a nice 
we | will come | check 
We | 're | the next two hours 
we | 're | another hour 
We | are going to be following | this thing 
the country | have already gotten | a taste of the storm 
It | could get | a whole lot 
CNN's Ali Velshi | is | Baytown 
they | refine | more than half-a-million barrels of crude 
what | is | the scene 
Baytown | is | the biggest one 
they | 're shutting | them 
power | having | those refineries 
these refineries | are | a little bit 
we | had | some refineries offline 
what | is | the effect 
the price of wholesale gas today | peaking | $ 4.90 
That | is | a big jump 
We | have seen | retail gas 
you | can still get | it 
We | have seen | Georgia 
you | talked | the beginning 
that | is | insured damage 
That | does n't count | the extra money 
everybody | 's going to pay | gasoline costs 
this | takes | a few days 
these refineries | get | the water 
The problem | is | they 
These refineries | cannot run when | they 
They | cannot run when | there 
that | is | what 
we | 're looking | right 
you | look | we 
we | 're | Baytown 
Galveston Bay | moves | the Houston Shipping Channel 
that water | keeps getting forced | Galveston 
it | is | a certainty 
that | is | about half of the Gulf Coast's refining capacity 
We | will check | you 
You | see | the difficulty 
we | are having | Gary Tuchman's audio 
Gary | filed | a taped report 
I | think | we 
we | ? | Gary 
you | hear | us 
What | 's happening | Gulfport 
we | hear... | > > COOPER 
we | hear | you 
I | 'm | meteorologist Rob Marciano 
We | 're right | the Gulf of Mexico 
This | is | the boulevard 
people | drive up and down | the beach 
you | see | the water 
I | can tell | you 
this | is really | something 
just | being | out 
The rain | 's been coming down | the last couple of hours 
you | think | the eye 
It | has got to be | ( AUDIO GAP ) north 
the wind | has been coming | the same direction 
that | means | the storm 
I | will tell | you 
what | 's been | me 
big the wave setup | was so early | the storm 
We | had | waves 
it | started to blow | rain 
this | is | just the wave setup 
we | get | the surge 
I | 'm impressed | seawall's been doing 
They | knew | what 
they | were doing when | they 
who | live | it 
who | are battened | down 
that | holds | it 
We | had | a wind meter 
We | were getting | 90-mile-per-hour gusts 
I | want to ask | Rob ( AUDIO GAP ) 
the National Weather Service | said | people 
who | live | one 
I | have never heard | that kind of warning before 
There | was | a similar warning 
that | came | Katrina 
what | was going to happen | a tee 
we | are n't staying | Galveston 
you | have mentioned | earlier 
AUDIO GAP ) | is | a perfect spot 
the structure | is built | a fortress 
It | is | kind of eerie 
I | will tell | you 
the | -- when | the lights 
the waves | keep | building 
it | is | a bit frightening 
that | is | one of the things 
The power | went | here a short time 
you | have | this complete dark situation 
You | have | people 
who | have stayed here | Galveston 
It | is | a mandatory evacuation 
we | are being told | authorities 
anyone | 's caught | evacuating 
I | will tell | you 
the authorities | are right now | our hotel 
it | reached | hurricane-force gusts 
we | 're staying | ( AUDIO GAP ) 
We | 're | a 15-story hotel 
that | was built to withstand | hurricane 
We | are | a one 
We | are | the beach 
It | is | a safe place 
police and emergency operations officials | are staying | our hotel 
AUDIO GAP | ) ride | it 
we | hear | this dire forecast 
We | hear | this dire forecast 
This | is | a Category 4 or 5 
It | 's even | a Category 3 yet 
I | 'm just echoing | what Chad 
This | is | just a huge storm 
it | has taken up | more than half the Gulf of Mexico 
it | has n't been | that big or 
it | 's been | it 
the surge | was | Katrina 
it | was | a huge storm 
you | have got to remember how | the floor of this Gulf 
the Gulf | is | surge 
that | is | what 
That | is why | they 
two-story homes | probably not having | a chance 
you | live | Galveston 
we | talked | you 
we | could see | 17 feet 
there | was | about 100 yards of beach 
The beach | has completely disappeared here | Galveston 
there | is | no seawall 
there | is | immense flooding 
that | leads | this next question 
I | 'm going to ask | you 
We | have heard | these forecasts 
almost all of Galveston | could be | water 
It | is | the seawall 
you | have got to remember how | the island 
it | is | an island 
the water | goes | the seawall 
we | could see | a reverse 
there | are | some high spots 
you | get | 15 
that | is built | 15 , 16 feet 
They | have n't been hit | a big hurricane 
I | will tell | you 
it | was happening | all day 
I | keep hearing | the word surge 
I | 'm thinking | the Iraq war 
we | are talking | a hurricane 
I | will tell | you 
there | is | more concern 
that | 's far away | us 
That | is | about a five-minute drive 
there | is | thoughts 
it | could be up | a 22-foot surge 
the elevation of this city | is | seven feet 
That | is | Yao Ming 
who | plays | the Houston Rockets 
it | is | a very flat city 
we | hope | people 
AUDIO GAP ) | > | > COOPER 
you | have | an estimate 
I | will tell | you 
that | is | what's incredible 
I | talked | you 
you | could still toss | a Frisbee 
There | is | no beach 
this | is | the street 
that | is | 17 feet 
you | can see | the water 
that | looks | the same level 
this | gives | you 
we | have seen | wave 
it | did n't start raining | about four hours 
the rain | is coming | buckets 
this | is | the time 
this | is | a very serious situation 
This | is | a huge storm 
It | took | virtually the entire Gulf of Mexico 
it | 's coming | this part of Texas 
it | is going to be | you 
we | 're going to check | you 
We | will keep | you 
We | will also have | a live report 
Sarah Palin | giving | more of her interview 
We | will show | you 
The View | facing | some pretty tough questions 
we | will show | you 
You | 're looking | pictures 
You | can see | the surf 
We | will see | what 
this | is really just | the beginning of this storm 
We | have yet to see | this storm's full ferocity 
We | anticipate | it 
We | have already started to get | a little bit more rain 
people | know | what 
there | is | a lot of concern 
We | will talk | that 
us | check | right 
who | has | some breaking news 
I | 'm | which 
what | are | you 
we | 're being told | this hour 
it | is actually | Lafitte 
which | is | Jefferson Parish 
this | is apparently | a temporarily levee 
It | failed | the last couple of hours 
I | believe | 8:00 
The mayor | has said | hundreds of homes 
We | 're getting | a little bit 
we | 're told | is 
this | is really related | more 
I | 'm pull | the details
