I | think | people's families 
people's children | are especially | off-limits 
This | should n't be | part of our politics 
It | has | no relevance 
Barack Obama | making | it 
' families | are | off-limits 
He | made | that remark 
it | was revealed | the 17-year-old daughter of Sarah Palin 
That | 's | the only new development 
There | are also | new details 
what's | being called | trooper-gate 
it | is | just allegations 
us | go | CNN's Kyra Phillips 
you | went | Alaska 
A lot | is | her 
There | are | a lot of stories 
there | was | this story 
People | are wondering | her values 
it | started initially | a lot of Internet chat 
there | was | even a picture of the governor circulating 
she | 's supposed to be | six months 
she | does n't look | six months 
we | started asking | questions 
we | hit | the ground 
Trig | is | the governor's brand-new baby 
I | have lost | contact 
we | will try and reconnect | you 
I | can hear | you 
I | hear | you 
I | thought | you 
There | is | a storm 
It | is | a little 
me | to hear | you 
her husband | released | a statement 
I | want to read | it 
We | are | Bristol's decision 
her baby | even prouder to become | grandparents 
Bristol | faces | the responsibilities of adulthood 
she | knows | she 
you | have been hearing | Alaska 
That | is | a good point 
Bristol's decision | to have | her baby 
Bristol | faces | the responsibilities of adulthood 
she | knows | she 
you | 've been hearing | Alaska 
That | is | a good point 
she | be | a mom 
five children | keep | care of that home 
this | is | the response 
it | makes | her 
my guess | is | that 
they | had | the conversation 
there | is | the unknown , Anderson 
this revelation | affect | the McCain campaign 
I | 'm | a psychic 
she | is | a staunch reporter 
she | has | a 17-year-old daughter 
us | see | what 
This | is definitely going to put | her 
us | see | she 
she | care | her family 
her children | also be | vice president 
You | hear | those questions 
I | do n't know | this 
I | 've yet to hear | Barack Obama 
you | be | a father 
care of your family | also be | president of the United States 
what | is | the deal 
anybody | can make | allegations 
The devil | is | the details 
you | got to see | proof 
I | want to talk | Troopergate 
I | think | it 
we | have to juggle | so many things 
we | love having | all these opportunities 
Gloria Steinem | say | gender 
there | is still | a lot of sexism 
that | does come | many times 
we | 'll probably see | a lot 
she | is | a woman 
we | 've been trying to find | more information 
she | use | her political rank 
who | is | a state trooper 
He | is | the middle of a custody battle 
these revelations | are coming forward | a phone call 
that | was put | the commissioner 
We | 're learning more | she 
that | 's representing | her now 
there | may be | a phone call 
it | is | all 
it | 's | my job 
I | know | the response 
us | hope | the next couple of days 
we | can actually find | what 
I | 'm | you 
> > Barack Obama | reacted | word of Sarah Palin's pregnant daughter 
' families | are | off-limits 
We | showed | you 
us | head | up 
? | > | WOLF BLITZER 
It | is | it 
A lot of people | will truly be | her 
This kind of situation | happens | the best of families 
I | suspect | there 
some who | will defend | her 
There | will be | others 
you | know | what 
There | is | a standard 
that | suggests | she 
That | is going to be | a big debate 
it | is clearly | a subject 
I | think | what 
Barack Obama | is | very strong statement 
I | suspect | that 
who | would have been | Governor Palin 
this | is | a 17-year-old young woman 
we | 're talking | who 
any effort | to be | the public eye 
It | does seem | kind of odd all 
she | 's now making | headlines 
what | do we know | this 
I | guess | some 
anybody | can make | allegations 
What | are | the facts 
the McCain camp | said | they 
They | say | they 
they | are convinced | neither the governor nor anyone 
there | is | an ongoing ethics investigation 
She | has hired | an attorney 
it | were | you 
you | knew | you 
you | would hire | an attorney 
We | need to let | this process 
the McCain campaign | is aggressively tonight distributing | news clips 
even officials | involved | the investigation 
there | is | no allegation 
herself | picked up | the phone 
we | 'll let | this one play out 
which | is | a difficult family issue 
this one | is | an allegation 
The McCain campaign | says | it 
she | did | nothing 
we | 'll follow | this one 
This attorney | is | part of a week 's-old effort 
worried | are | they 
that | are now coming | about Governor Palin 
I | know | Senator McCain 
he | started to consider | her 
there | was | the second meeting 
the McCain campaign | saying | she 
her | > | BLITZER 
they | 're saying | she 
she | spent | hours 
they | say | she 
She | welcomes | this investigation 
They | are making | very serious charges 
I | 'm not going to get | specifics 
other than | to say | there 
they | say | there 
they | 're saying | she 
they | say | they 
they | feel | she 
We | 'll talk | this next hour 
what | 's going to happen | tomorrow 
I | 'm | all the plans
