I | think | people's families 
people's children | are especially | off-limits 
This | should n't be | part of our politics 
It | has | no relevance 
Barack Obama | making | it 
' families | are | off-limits 
He | made | that remark 
it | was revealed | the 17-year-old daughter of Sarah Palin 
That | 's | the only new development 
There | are also | new details 
what's | being called | trooper-gate 
it | is | just allegations 
us | go | CNN's Kyra Phillips 
you | went | Alaska 
A lot | is | her 
There | are | a lot of stories 
there | was | this story 
People | are wondering | her values 
it | started initially | a lot of Internet chat 
there | was | even a picture of the governor circulating 
she | 's supposed to be | six months 
she | does n't look | six months 
we | started asking | questions 
we | hit | the ground 
Trig | is | the governor's brand-new baby 
I | have lost | contact 
we | will try and reconnect | you 
I | can hear | you 
I | hear | you 
I | thought | you 
There | is | a storm 
It | is | a little 
me | to hear | you 
her husband | released | a statement 
I | want to read | it 
We | are | Bristol's decision 
her baby | even prouder to become | grandparents 
Bristol | faces | the responsibilities of adulthood 
she | knows | she 
you | have been hearing | Alaska 
That | is | a good point 
Bristol's decision | to have | her baby 
Bristol | faces | the responsibilities of adulthood 
she | knows | she 
you | 've been hearing | Alaska 
That | is | a good point 
she | be | a mom 
five children | keep | care of that home 
this | is | the response 
it | makes | her 
my guess | is | that 
they | had | the conversation 
there | is | the unknown , Anderson 
this revelation | affect | the McCain campaign 
I | 'm | a psychic 
she | is | a staunch reporter 
she | has | a 17-year-old daughter 
us | see | what 
This | is definitely going to put | her 
us | see | she 
she | care | her family 
her children | also be | vice president 
You | hear | those questions 
I | do n't know | this 
I | 've yet to hear | Barack Obama 
you | be | a father 
care of your family | also be | president of the United States 
what | is | the deal 
anybody | can make | allegations 
The devil | is | the details 
you | got to see | proof 
I | want to talk | Troopergate 
I | think | it 
we | have to juggle | so many things 
we | love having | all these opportunities 
Gloria Steinem | say | gender 
there | is still | a lot of sexism 
that | does come | many times 
we | 'll probably see | a lot 
she | is | a woman 
we | 've been trying to find | more information 
she | use | her political rank 
who | is | a state trooper 
He | is | the middle of a custody battle 
these revelations | are coming forward | a phone call 
that | was put | the commissioner 
We | 're learning more | she 
that | 's representing | her now 
there | may be | a phone call 
it | is | all 
it | 's | my job 
I | know | the response 
us | hope | the next couple of days 
we | can actually find | what 
I | 'm | you
