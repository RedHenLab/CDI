there | is | no plan 
no way | to know | what 
I | heard | you 
you | think | this thing 
That | is | what 
it | is | my personal opinion 
These | are | deep problems 
they | sign | this bill 
they | sign | this bill 
it | does n't mean | everything 
You | have | all these things 
it | 's going to take | a long , long time 
I | think | you 
You | 're going to see | the markets 
they | do n't do | something 
these things | take | time 
it | was | 2000 
the markets | started to freak | a while 
It | took | us 
it | seems | a long time 
You | believe | you 
you | stay | the market 
you | have | time 
much time | is | time 
Time | is | at least 10 years 
you | need | this money 
this | is just | something 
You | need | at least ten years 
you | 're | retirement 
you | need | this money 
you | ca n't be afford to be | this market 
Anything | can happen | any time 
all | learn that | September 11 
You | have to be prepared | the worst 
Nicky ( ph ) | writes | a question 
I | suspend | contributions 
you | 're asking | a question 
you | 're not telling | me 
I | answer | that 
You | do n't tell | me 
You | do n't tell | me 
You | do n't tell | me 
your 401( k ) | match | your contributions 
You | 're not telling | me 
you | have | credit card debt 
you | max | out 
you | continue to put | as much as possible 
I | have never wanted | people 
You | listen | me 
your 401( k | matches | your contribution 
you | put | a dollar 
they | give | you 
I | do n't care | how much credit card debt 
I | do n't care | what 
that | is | a 50 percent return 
this | is assuming | you 
you | need | this money 
You | 're far better | you 
you | take | that extra money 
you | take | that extra money 
you | have | extra money 
you | know | you 
It | is | a 401( k 
There | is | a padding 
your 401( k | ) | the max 
I | keep hearing | everyone 
this | might be | the time 
I | 'm | a junior 
college | am wondering | what specific things 
we | should be putting | our money 
you | have | student loans 
student loan debt | can never be dismissed or discharged | bankruptcy 
you | make | it 
yourself | up | so this 
you | do n't have | any credit card debt 
Have money | set aside | you 
you | take | advantage of your life 
you | can buy | a home 
I | 'd rather see | you 
a home | get | a home 
the time | comes | be investing 
People | are talking | wealthy and middle class 
who | are receiving | Social Security and disability 
we | be | our benefits 
this bill | does not pass | the market 
the truth of the matter | is | you 
It | had | nothing 
we | are underfunded | Social Security 
Medicare | has always kind of been | trouble 
These | are | things 
you | think | anybody else 
This | is | an example 
our representatives | do n't have | the intelligence
