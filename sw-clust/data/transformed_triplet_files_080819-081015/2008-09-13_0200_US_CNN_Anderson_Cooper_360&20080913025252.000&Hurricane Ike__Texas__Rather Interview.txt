Hurricane Carla | slammed | the Texas shorelines 
It | remains | one of the most powerful storms 
a young reporter | named | Dan Rather 
Evacuations | should be hastened | it 
Dan Rather | is keeping | a very close eye 
Dan Rather's the host | managing | editor of " Dan Rather Reports 
He | joins | me 
thanks | being | us 
what | worries | you 
What | worries | me 
the most | is | people 
who | live | the Texas coast 
it | is | another hurricane 
The weather bureau | has called | this a colossal storm 
They | 're talking | $ 10 billion 
This | is | a particularly dangerous hurricane 
it | 's coming and aimed directly | Houston 
us | hope | it 
Houston | is | a great metropolis 
the country's fourth largest city | has | these tall buildings 
the wind | will cause | a lot of glass damage 
What | worries | me 
we | talk | a storm surge 
what | used to be called | the old days 
a storm surge | lasts | many hours 
who | were | what 
I | will call | the northwest quadrant of the hurricane 
that | is | above Houston 
I | do n't want to be | an alarmist 
I | think | the favorite word 
this | is literally | a colossal hurricane 
people | living | one 
you | heard | such a dire hurricane warning 
I | was kind of shocked | it 
anyone else | ever heard | such a dire hurricane warning 
I | do n't know | what 
weather forecasters | are always trying to strike | that balance 
panic | driving | home 
there | are | a lot of those areas 
I | 'd have to weigh | the side 
who | are | one 
who | have n't gotten | out 
You | were there | 1961 
What | was | the aftermath 
it | take | Galveston 
It | took | a very long time 
it | will | this case 
they | have | a frontier mentality 
Houston | is | the can-do capital of the world 
They | have | a great community spirit 
this area | is going to need | a lot of help 
it | 's going to take | a lot of us 
us | hope | they 
it | will be | a long time 
You | pioneered | storm coverage 
You | were | the first one 
I | appreciate | your expertise
