John McCain | tied | the polls 
that | could make or break | them 
that | could make | all the difference 
Obama country | will be | a major challenge 
Portsmouth | hugs | the Ohio River 
the jobs | will ever return | the old rule 
hard times | means | votes 
Democrats | will apply | this year 
chairman Randy Bashem | sees | the chance 
the other end of the phone | say | they 
It | comes down | that 
it | is probably | the hardest place 
Southern Ohio | is | probably 2 percent 
Obama | was trounced here | the Democratic primaries 
Hillary Clinton | won | 81 percent of the vote 
Obama | has yet to fix | things 
they | 're | that southern Ohio 
southeast Ohio | equals winning | the White House 
The Democrats | have carried | this region 
Those | happen to be | the party 
there | is | a hopeful vibe 
The younger staff | is | all 
I | think | people 
more my age | seem to be | McCain 
there | is | more Obama people 
An office worker | felt compelled to pin | a flag 
The overwhelming issue | is | jobs 
local Democrats | are still rebutting | rumors 
their candidate | wo n't wear | a flag pin 
I | have | that question 
I | talk to | our community 
There | is | no doubt 
Senator Obama | is | a Muslim 
He | 's | a left-wing 
Jean Carlson | is | a Goldwater-Republican-turned-Obama 
She | sees | questions 
I | think | it 
I | think | it 
I | think | it 
Local Republicans | say | the race factor 
that Obama | is just | these parts 
Obama's chance | to make | history 
he | can change | perceptions
