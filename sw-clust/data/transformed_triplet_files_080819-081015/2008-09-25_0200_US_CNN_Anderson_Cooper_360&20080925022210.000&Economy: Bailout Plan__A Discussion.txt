It | appears | me 
John McCain | is trying to divert | attention 
That | was | Harry Reid earlier today 
the senator majority leader | taking | some shots 
he | calls | his friend 
they | want | McCain 
this | is | politics 
there | is | plenty of politics 
us | head back | our panel 
soon | does | something 
I | 'm going to tell | you 
you | can draw | the conclusions 
It | was | sort of the largest borrowing 
this announcement | was made | last Thursday 
It | was | $ 1.3 billion 
they | paid | about 7 percent interest 
That | is almost double | what 
they | would have paid | a week 
They | have | no credit line 
there | is | inability 
them | to bring | money 
they | are going to have to not spend | it 
there | is | one connection 
you | make | this 
that | is | your job 
They | do | that once 
They | do go | their job 
there | is | all this talk 
that | could work | people's jobs 
We | need to see | the first one 
people | have | money 
Caterpillar | needs to borrow | money 
you | say | there 
that | makes | you 
( LAUGHTER ) | > | > BRANCACCIO 
us | do n't understand | this complicated bailout 
That | is | one of the problems 
I | do n't understand | it 
The American people | do n't understand | it 
these | are | very smart folks 
who | are paid to understand | this sort of stuff 
he | does n't understand | it 
enough details | to fully get | his head 
I | do n't feel | he 
I | was working | a metaphor 
who | is | a stockbroker 
It | is basically | this 
us | say | you 
What kind of price | would you get | it 
you | could have | more time 
you | could have | six months 
you | would get | a good price 
the government bailout | proposes to do give | these companies 
they | can get | a slightly better price 
they | 're going to propose | some sort of plan 
What | are | some of the main sticking points 
lawmakers | are trying to work | they 
There | are | a number of them 
They | include | measures 
that | would change | the way people 
who | are | homeowners 
bankrupt | can deal | their losses 
Republicans | do n't like | the plan 
a major sticking point | to end | the package 
There | are | other measures 
This | is | the thing 
we | have heard | them 
taxpayers | should n't invest | these companies 
big sticking point | is | just how big 
Seven hundred billion | is | what 
they | want | the administration 
it | 's necessarily | what 
Congress | will give | them 
I | talk to up here | both sides 
the pressure | to get | something 
They | would rather do | it 
They | have to figure | these 
we | heard | this 
he | was | he 
this | should not be | the whole kitchen sink 
They | are | valid concerns 
this for Americans | would be | it 
a Wall Street bailout | starts to have | some provisions 
We | need to free | the credit markets 
we | need | some deal 
it | is | a bit of a red herring 
It | is | a major , major problem 
There | is | no question 
It | 's been | a major problem 
that | is | something 
they | can | all 
who | started | the fire 
we | have got to put | the fire 
there | is | so much anger 
I | understand why | people 
you | see | these politicians 
Where | were | these questions 
everyone | is suddenly shocked to find | there 
gambling | going | in 
I | was talking | somebody 
who | went | this early 
the week | thinking | it 
they | are | a system 
that | does n't penalize | the people 
there | is | a continuing debate 
You | heard | there 
who | are thinking | we 
there | could be | a first tranche of this funding 
the investors | put | that kind of situation 
they | get | their money 
We | will see | what
