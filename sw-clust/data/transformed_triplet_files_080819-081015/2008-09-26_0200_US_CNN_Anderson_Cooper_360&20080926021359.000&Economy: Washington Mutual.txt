Katie Couric | is | >> > COOPER 
There | is | the bailout plan 
They | 're going to continue | tomorrow 
This | happening | just a short time 
Its deposits | have been bought | J.P. Morgan Chase 
us | get | the latest 
What | does | this mean 
Ali | > | ALI VELSHI 
this | is | the biggest bank failure 
which | was | the largest savings and loan 
this credit crisis | has made | it 
this company | to raise | money 
It | was not going to get | a buyer 
It | was closed | the Office of Thrift Supervision 
its assets | were sold | J.P. Morgan Chase 
nobody | loses | money 
you | were | a shareholder 
It | does n't look | some other financial companies 
you | are | a shareholder 
you | get virtually | nothing 
you | have | money 
This | is even | the $ 100,000 limit 
J.P. Morgan Chase | is now | your banker 
it | is | the largest failure of a bank 
we | 're going to talk | you 
there | is so | much breaking news 
Washington Mutual's demise | comes | the financial bailout plan 
we | showed | you 
Capitol Hill | fighting | which deal 
there | should be | any deal 
talk | putting | politics 
Republicans | are offering | proposals and counterproposals 
us | have | a " Strategy Session 
what | do you make | this 
LAUGHTER ) | > | > GLORIA BORGER 
I | think | it 
I | have never seen | anything 
Barack Obama | go | Washington today 
I | do n't think | it 
I | do n't think | it 
you | have to have | both of them 
we | have been reporting | all day 
this | was | a very contentious meeting 
what | was | me 
who | have thrown | a grenade 
this | are | the House Republicans 
They | do n't have | any use 
He | is | 28 percent 
they | do n't have | much use 
They | have disagreed | him 
Brianna Keilar | is | the phone 
new details of what | happened tonight | this meeting 
what | are | you 
we | heard | Representative Barney Frank 
They | said | they 
we | are not going to come | a conclusion 
this | is | the first time 
this | is | what Barney Frank 
they | were presented | a paper plan 
who | have obviously been | the ones 
who | are not seeing | eye 
it | included | a mortgage insurance plan 
it | includes cutting | the capital gains tax 
they | were rejecting | that proposal 
we | heard | Senator Judd Gregg 
who | 's really taken | negotiations 
He | said | he 
it | is | yet 
We | 're focusing | things 
we | talked | this morning 
we | can move | that 
there | 's going to be | another meeting 
it | 's going to include | Senate Republicans 
we | 're not expecting | House Republicans 
House Republicans | are | that meeting 
what | is | the point of that meeting 
> > | ED | ROLLINS 
they | 're | the meeting 
the bottom line | is | this 
The House Republicans | are | a different breed 
What | is going | them 
they | feel | Bush 
he | 's gone | 116 days 
They | do n't care | anybody 
They | have | no relationship 
they | care | anything 
I | include | Democratic congressmen 
They | 're | reelected 
They | 're | all going 
They | 're | safe districts 
who | are going to lose | seats 
there | is | a lot of people 
we | rebuild | the party 
we | want to rebuild | this party 
who | is always | kind of questionable 
the time | to draw | the line 
It | is | pretty scary stuff 
They | 're thinking | party 
I | think | they 
they | 're thinking | themselves 
I | think | they 
the threat | is | a lot of other people 
there | is always | this sort of do-the-right-thing gene 
it | 's frustrating | a lot of analysts 
this | is | a set of policies 
his party | put | place 
you | claiming | there 
no politics | involved | the Democrats 
this | > | BEGALA 
they | rushing to bail | Bush 
I | think | it 
who | are | it 
this | is | the right thing 
us | give | them 
This | may not be | just party 
They | may be | ideology 
it | is | an ideology 
that | say | this 
This | is | their solution 
a lot of people | think | that 
what | got | us 
we | let | these financial institutions 
we | had | excessive tax cuts 
it | is | the captain of the Titanic 
we | need | more icebergs 
it | had | no oversight 
It | did n't have | the 
It | did n't have | a lot of things 
Americans | -- | Americans 
I | 'm giving | these folks money 
I | get | any return 
Those | are | the kinds of things 
you | have | this other group 
I | believe | it 
it | did | any good 
I | think | it 
it | helped | John McCain's campaign 
I | would have said | this ahead of the meeting 
I | think | the bottom line 
this | has happened | two weeks 
these people | represent | Middle America 
they | think | they 
they | were | Wall Street 
they | were | small-town America 
the world | is coming | an end 
I | have been | this business 
the president | gave | the most doom-and-gloom speech 
I | have ever heard | my life 
everybody | did n't rush | their bank 
they | 're getting bombarded | little people 
what | is | this 
I | have got to tell | you 
last night | give | that speech 
it | was | his words 
He | is | a 
he | 's a... ( | CROSSTALK) > > BEGALA 
I | 'm going to get | trouble 
He | is | a high-functioning moron 
that | is | what 
Congress | treats | him 
They | did n't pay | any attention 
They | had | a huge fight 
The president | is not directing | this 
He | sent | Paulson out 
people | say | he 
That | is | the other part 
They | have | no respect 
Congress | does n't know | Paulson 
the American people | have | any confidence 
their pockets | were being lined | Fannie Mae 
they | were supposed to be | the ones 
It | turned | they 
it | was | oversight 
It | was | no sight 
I | think | that 
John McCain | decided to make | this tactical move 
he | saw | himself 
who | could tap | that mistrust of government 
I | can work | both sides 
I | can work | this out 
I | will rescue | Washington 
John McCain | has always gone | the other side 
Kennedy | to put | the health care 
he | 's never bought | his team 
he | 's never bought | the House Republicans 
I | think | yes 
John McCain | be | part of that debate 
we | were saying | this 
McCain | refuses to go | Ole Miss 
this | is | a bad place 
we | do n't need | a moderator 
I | think | Barack Obama 
I | think | he 
the cable stations | will cover | it 
40 million people | watching | him 
It | is | a an incredible day 
what | happened | the scenes 
Obama and McCain | went | Washington today 
Sarah Palin | talking | Katie Couric 
You | have got | kind 
it | to believe | it
