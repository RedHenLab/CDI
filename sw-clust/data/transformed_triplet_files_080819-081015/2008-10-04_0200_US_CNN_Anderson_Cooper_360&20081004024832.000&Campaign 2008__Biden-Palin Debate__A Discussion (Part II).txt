I | may not answer | the questions 
you | want to hear | I 
the American people | let | them 
I | love | him 
He | has been | a maverick 
he | has been | no maverick 
He | 'd voted | four to five times 
which | put | us 
That | is | talk 
There | is | no doubt Sarah Palin 
she | has certainly energized | the base 
she | stimulated | the base 
the editor of the " National Review " magazine | wrote | I 
I | 'm | I 
Palin | dropped | her first wink 
I | think | she 
she | knew | she 
it | was | it 
It | sent | starbursts 
the screen | ricocheting | the living rooms of America 
That | is | quality 
it | 's either something | you 
she | 's got | it 
She | was asked | this 
us | listen | today 
those interviews | was | a little bit 
it | is | Man 
you | choose to answer | a question 
you | 're going to get clobbered | the answer 
you | choose to try to pivot and go | another subject 
you | believe | Americans 
you | get clobbered | that 
I | did feel | there 
she | was missing | terms of an opportunity 
the values | are represented | our ticket 
she | reads | the " New York Times 
What | do | you 
we | saw | Palin 
I | watched | her 
I | did n't get | the sense 
there | was | an answer 
I | think | they 
It | reminded | me 
there | was | one Ronald Reagan presidential debate 
he | was | facts and figure 
you | could n't follow | him 
It | was | all 
Ronald Reagan | does n't know | specifics 
he | is | a generalist 
They | sent | him 
it | was | he 
There | were | so many dos 
she | went | there 
It | struck | me 
she | was | she 
it | to say | what 
you | 're preparing | a candidate 
Sarah Palin | was coached | last night 
they | 've been coached | days 
many of them | have been coached | years 
it | 's got to be | a fine line 
back and | not giving | them 
There | was | 1984 
Walter Mondale | went so badly | Reagan 
people | had | questions 
He | had | a great comeback 
you | remember | that second debate 
That | is when | he 
he | was asked | about 
He | said | I 
I | think | there 
I | think | the brain lock 
the right word | to describe | what 
we | seemed to see | Sarah Palin 
I | think taking | her 
Sedona | going out there | the trees 
her family | seems to have | done wonders 
I | 've seen | happen 
I | worked | Al Gore 
he | was coming to do | that famous debate 
He | got | a little locked up 
himself | was | a much , much better candidate 
He | found | himself 
I | want to play | just one other thing Palin 
that | said | today 
I | read | the same things 
the country | read including | the " New York Times 
we | 've recently been interviewed to up there | Alaska 
we | 're doing | oil and gas 
we | talked | this a little bit before 
you | see | her 
she | can show | this side of herself 
that | reads | the " New York Times " 
you | watched | the debate 
she | was looking either | Biden 
she | was | beat expectations 
It | is when | she 
front of the other | hold | the baby 
the same time | be | herself 
she | can do | that 
she | is | a better debater 
I | 'm | time 
She | beat | expectations 
She | was | a foreign policy expert 
Joe Biden | won | the debate 
He | brought | the sophistication 
all | said | the same thing 
We | 're going to leave | it 
all those analysts | staring intently | their screens 
what one of our pundits | was caught watching | last night's debate coverage 
I | 'll give | you 
it | 's | David Gergen 
we | break | the bailout vote 
What | made | it 
it | going to take | any of us 
we | see | relief 
That | is ahead | " 360
