above | to save | those 
You | 're looking | a helicopter rescue operation 
Heavy rains | breached | a dam 
flood waters | surging | the national park 
that | has | emergency crews 
We | get | the latest 
A racing river of mud | hurling | trees and debris 
Helicopters | plucking | stranded tourists 
They | are | the first sweeping media images of Arizona's dam break 
Everybody | is walking | all muddy 
Now the first private photographs | are coming | the survivors 
his camping buddies | documented | their own unfathomable survival story 
it | was | a water bed 
I | was grabbing | my bags 
my sandals | were already gone | the river 
the first ten | terrifying | minutes 
water | rose | his knees 
his friends | abandoned | their tents 
I | saw how rapidly | it 
everybody | was getting | their things out 
that | is when | I 
We | were just shocked | the rushing waters 
we | heard | trees 
all 15 | scrambled up | the side of the cliff 
the water | kept rising | what 
they | believe | was 10 , 12 
we | could even try | kind of climb 
you | knew | you 
The tribe | had | a black helicopter 
we | saw them fly | a basket 
I | think | they 
who | were hanging | trees 
They | watched | the rising water 
We | 've got | everybody 
rescue operations | finished | the evening 
Sheriff officials | tell | us 
there | are | 11 people 
they | say | they 
who | wanted to be flown out | that flooded area 
They | performed | a total of 270 evacuations 
no deaths or serious injuries | reported | this point
