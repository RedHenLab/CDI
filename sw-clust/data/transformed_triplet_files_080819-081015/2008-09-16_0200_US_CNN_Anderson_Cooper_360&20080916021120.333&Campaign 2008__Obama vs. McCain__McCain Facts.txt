Governor Sarah Palin today | still claiming | she 
Her statement | is | one of those sort 
we | have been hearing | a whole lot of recently 
accusations of lies and misrepresentations | have reached | an extraordinary level 
we | will look | some of Senator Obama's statements 
that | have been called | question 
we | focus primarily | the McCain's campaign 
it | has | both Democrats and Republicans 
what | 's going | the McCain campaign 
Sarah Palin | are lying | their way 
I | think | those 
who | say | John McCain 
Governor Palin | are lying | anything 
this campaign | need to pay | closer attention 
The Obama campaign | has also been accused | mistruths 
McCain | wanted to spend | 100 years 
troops | should stay | non-combat roles 
he | wanted | 100 years of war 
Obama | turned up | the heat

sex | learning to read | ? 
Obama | want to teach | sex education 
The programming question | was intended to teach | kids 
a young age | learn | about 
that | might be made | them 
Our ads | are based | honesty and truth 
she | keeps hammering home | one point 
I | told | Congress 
Congress | has already killed | that project 
the bridge | plays | a bigger theme of the McCain campaign 
Sarah Palin | is | the perfect crusader 
McCain | rid | Washington of its addiction 
This | is | what 
McCain | said | The View 
THE VIEW" | > | > MCCAIN 
she | vetoed | a half 
She | took | some earmark spending 
Governor Palin | cut | Alaska's earmark requests 
the state | asked | $ 197 million 
She | says | she 
that | would have called | earmarks 
that | does n't get rid | the fact 
she | did ask | earmarks 
Alaska | provides | 20 percent of the energy 
the U.S. | Is | that true 
it | is | 3.5 percent 
It | is | big deal 
John McCain | have been claiming | Palin 
Alaska | has | a good bit of oil 
we | had confirmed | the campaign 
She | went | Kuwait 
She | entered | Iraq 
We | checked | the Army National Guard 
they | told | us 
they | are | 100 percent 
sure Palin | made | it 
she | entered | Iraq 
it | was | a refueling stop

FOX NEWS SUNDAY" | > | KARL ROVE 
mistruths | can work well | the party base 
which | is conditioned to believe | the campaign 
it | is | the facts 
the truth | will catch | it 
you | know | it 
We | are going to look | the Obama claims tomorrow night 
You | have also been covering | the case of the fire trooper and public safety commissioner 
The Alaska legislature | is investigating | Sarah Palin 
governor | to get | the fire safety commissioner 
There | was | some action 
the governor | fired | this public safety commissioner 
She | says | it 
He | says | it 
he | did | n't fire trooper Mike Wooten 
who | was actually | the ex 
who | had threatened | her family 
they | 're looking | there 
any abuse of power | trying to get | him 
the campaign | held | a presser 
they | are | this 
the governor | wo n't be interviewed | investigators 
it | does | the simple truth 
Our political campaign | weighs | lies 
that | does n't mean | she 
Palin | to answer | a question 
a cell phone distraction | play | a role
