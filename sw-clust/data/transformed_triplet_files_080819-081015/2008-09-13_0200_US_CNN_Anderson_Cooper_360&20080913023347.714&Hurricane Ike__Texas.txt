you | talking | Chad

That | is | what 
He | said | it

This | is why | La Porte 
La Porte | is | one of the cities 
that | is right | the edges of Galveston Bay 
just the coastal cities | are n't going to be affected | Galveston 
you | were talking | Rob and Gary 
that | are actually ( | AUDIO GAP ) 
that wall of water | is going to be pushing | the Gulf of Mexico 
That | is why | this thing 
That | is why | they 
all | called | the evacuation order 
Police | have established | a curfew 
they | 're being | real mindful 
They | keep going | every five minutes or so 
most of the people | have heeded | the warnings 
We | 're expecting | the next hour

you | saw | Gary and Rob 
the real thing | to be looking | that 
that | may be | Andrew

Helicopters | have been ferrying | people 
They | 're trying to meet | people 
the appropriate spots | to hook | loved ones 
they | 're | hospitals 
It | is | it 
you | see | pictures 
it | is expected to be | a very 
We | know | you 
We | understand | Chad 
You | see | the radar track 
we | are just starting to feel | rain 
this | has been | a fairly dry west side of a hurricane 
we | have | hurricanes 
all | have | their own personalities 
you | just get | there ten hours 
the eye | is close | you 
this storm | has been | a little bit dry 
We | do n't have | the discussion 
which | is why | they 
we | have | the preliminary numbers 
They | 're keeping | 110 miles 
They | 're not making | it 
they | are still moving | it 
That | is | the surface 
you | go | 30 stories 
some of those buildings | are | Houston 
you | 're going to add | another 10 to 20 miles 
we | 're looking | 105 
that | is right up there | strong Category 
it | will be dying | a little bit 
those winds | will not be dying | those tall skyscrapers 
I | know | I 
I | need | you 
we | can go | the night 
I | do n't have to worry | glass 
we | 've got | a couple fall-back positions 
we | feel | it 
we | 're watching very closely | the Chase Tower 
which | took | a bit 
We | 're going to show | that 
the broadcast | see how | it 
They | are | the outer 
there | is | almost two eye walls 
They | 're | the outer part of the eye wall 
there | is | another eye wall 
They | 're | a 60- to 70- mile-per-hour wind 
I | do believe | they 
it | is | all 
We | 're going to check | Gary Tuchman 
we | 'll check | you 
Gas prices | up | the country 
Hurricane Ike | could do | many Houston's refineries 
you | 're looking | comes 
the worst | to come | Galveston 
The worst | is yet to come | Galveston 
us | check | Gary Tuchman 
I | understand | you 
We | have | a fall-back position 
We | were going to stay | the beach 
we | felt | it 
It | came | the point 
we | moved | this parking garage 
you | can see | what 
It | is | a wild scene 
the water's been | coming | it 
That | is | the case 
It | was | wind 
that | was just pushing | us 
Fifteen minutes | to walk | 200 yards 
What kind of devastation | is taking | place 
We | have | absolutely no idea 
It | is | a very foreboding situation 
you | see | lights 
me | is | we 
we | 're using | most of Galveston 
We | think | that 
It | sounds | a roaring freight train 
that | 's going | this city 
this city | to be | a few hours 
it | is | a very frightening evening 
whose lives | are connected | Galveston 
I | want | you 
I | want to bring in | Chad Myers 
who | 's monitoring | the situation 
we | look | Gary's picture 
the National Weather Service | had said | it 
I | know | the wake of Katrina everyone's worried 
they | want to get | messages 
I | would say | they 
that | moved | a few people 
that | was | a very accurate and good statement 
you | have | all these people 
that | want to stay | their homes 
their stuff | do n't realize | the water's 
there | 's not going to be | anything 
there | is | no reason 
I | think | that 
you | 're | a one-story building 
you | 're | a two-story 
this | could really be completely | your head 
that | is | what 
people | were | their homes 
they | climbed up | their attics 
we | lost | a lot of people 
I | think | that 
you | go just | a mile 
it | is | only five feet 
there | is | a 17 
that person | 's going to be | 15 feet 
That | is | certain death 
who | -- | folks 
who | are watching | home 
Galveston | going to get | the worst of it 
Galveston | is going to get out | the worst 
they | 're seeing now | about 45 minutes 
They | 're going to get | the outer eye wall 
They | 're going to be | a lull 
I | would say | that 
we | make | landfall 
which | means | the center of the eye 
I | do n't think | that 
We | 're going to bring | you 
you | live | all our viewers 
who | are watching | home 
we | 'll check | you 
We | lost | Gary Tuchman 
We | 're going to try to re-establish | contact 
It | is | Galveston
