He | did n't know | a few months 
he | had launched | his political career 
( AUDIENCE BOOING ) | > | > PALIN 
their ticket | does n't define | higher taxes 
It | is | the McCain campaign 
it | is | anything 
You | heard | a key part of the strategy 
Obama | palled | a terrorist 
We | will look | the facts 
we | 're | the trail 
McCain | is turning | the heat 
you | do n't really know | Barack Obama 
What | does he plan | America 
Who | is | the real Barack Obama 
you | ask | such questions 
you | get | response 
McCain aides | say | his central goal 
who | 's already authored | two memoirs 
he | 's exactly | an open book 
other candidates | have to explain | themselves 
Senator Obama | seems to think | he 
McCain | accused | Obama 
you | would think | he 
there | is absolutely | nothing 
his record | to suggest | he 
( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ) | > | > BASH 
Obama's spokesman | responded | words 
this race | accusing | him 
McCain's quest | to label | Obama 
he | stuck | policy 
it | 's been | William Ayers 
a 1960s radical whose group | bombed | U.S. buildings 
Ayers | hosted | a campaign meeting 
This | is | someone 
who | sees | America 
imperfect enough | to work | a former domestic terrorist 
who | had targeted | his own country 
Sarah Palin | toned | her initial accusation 
Obama | palled around | Ayers 
he | did n't know | the history 
who | had said | the two 
Ayers | helped | Obama 
he | did n't know | his radical past 
McCain | has called | him 
She | told | conservative columnist Bill Kristol 
I | do n't know why | that association 
those | were | appalling things 
the pastor | had said | our great country 
it | is | John McCain's call 
the campaign | brings up | Jeremiah Wright 
She | said | Kristol 
it | is up | John McCain 
or not | to bring | it 
she | brought | it 
you | know | what 
John McCain | said | it 
I | am going to leave | it 
she | was | what 
She | said | the talking points 
we | heard | the Democratic primary 
this | is | a guy 
Barack Obama | sat | this guy's church 
she | knew | what 
them | say | they 
a little bit | frustrated | their own candidate kind of put the political handcuffs 
you | 're talking | associations 
they | think | who 
who | has | a real relationship 
at least | had | a real relationship 
Palin | trying to tie | her 
this '60s radical group | questioning | his love of country 
I | am just | this 
who | sees | America 
I | see | America 
( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ) | > | > COOPER 
we | 're going to check | the facts 
Who's | really telling | the truth 
We | will also look | new polls 
The numbers | are | Obama's favor
