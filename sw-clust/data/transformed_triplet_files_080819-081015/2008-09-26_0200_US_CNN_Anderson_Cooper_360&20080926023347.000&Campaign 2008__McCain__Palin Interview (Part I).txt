we | looked | John McCain's huge political gamble 
the line | acting | presidential and 
you | might say | softer approach 
you | can be | the judge 
It | is | leadership 
John McCain's urgent hard-charging effort | to look | he 
Barack Obama's effort | to look | control 
this | is putting | jobs 
Obama | did not directly accuse | McCain 
He | is | that 
you | inject | presidential politics 
it | 's necessarily | it 
there | is | a lot of glare 
there | is | the potential 
Obama | can afford to stay | Washington 
He | has | plenty of help 
who | have been tearing | McCain 
I | would suggest | anyone 
that | tried to understand | what 
John McCain | said | the meeting 
He | was | the last person 
I | think | this 
Obama's campaign | has spent | a day 
a half | blasting | McCain 
his falling poll numbers | rising | criticism of Sarah Palin 
an Obama spokesman | saying | McCain's suspension of his campaign 
his aides | are campaigning | this so-called suspension 
an occasion | to promote | his campaign 
it | is | full speed 
Obama | intends to fly | Mississippi tomorrow 
presidents | need to show | they 
they | gave | a debate 
they | believe | McCain 
there | is | talk of perhaps a town-hall meeting 
There | is | a report 
that | is n't confirmed | the campaign 
they | will make | note of the fact 
John McCain | is there | he 
I | guess | there 
there | might be | a vote 
Democrats | are | control 
I | guess | they 
Obama | is down | Mississippi 
They | wanted to leave | Friday 
there | is | a certain urgency 
I | 'm shocked to hear | their political agendas
