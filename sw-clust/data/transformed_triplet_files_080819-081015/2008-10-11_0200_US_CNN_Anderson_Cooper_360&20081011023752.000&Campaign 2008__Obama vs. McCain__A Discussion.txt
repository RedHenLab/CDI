>> | > | John McCain 
they | attacked | Barack Obama 
we | heard | McCain 
his way | to correct | a supporter 
who | called | Obama an Arab or scary 
him | to calm | these crowds 
most important thing | is | you 
I | 'm not trying to say | the lady 
I | think | he 
he | is making | Obama 
I | said | it 
he | 's making | Obama 
I | want to play | just that moment 
I | think | it 
it | is just | such a crystallized moment 
this woman | says | this and McCain reacts 
I | ca n't trust | Obama 
I | have read | him 
he | is | an Arab 
He | is | a 
he | is | a decent family man 
I | happen to have | disagreements 
What | do you make | that moment 
I | find | it 
the real story | is | John McCain 
there | have been | times 
we | respected so much | Washington 
He | reappeared here | today 
he | deserves | praise 
Here | is where | I 
he | is trying to sort | calm 
his campaign | is running | these really tough attacks 
her usual | ranting | things 
she | says | many good things 
Rant | is probably | a word 
she | has allowed | things 
that | have | no place 
she | should put | a stop 
he | should put | a stop 
David | says | John McCain 
what | does it say | John McCain that 
he | does n't want to engage | some of the more aggressive things 
he | does seem to allow | folks 
There | 's been | a disconnect 
he | 's done | the campaign trail 
I | agree | David 
I | was | Mike Huckabee's chairman 
I | watched | debate 
Everybody | had | great respect 
we | ca n't win | it 
I | want | John McCain 
Something | happened | John McCain 
he | got | this battle 
And I think part of it is there was a sense of entitlement: I've done this; I deserve it; this is my chance. 
I | think | part 
And I think part of it is there was a sense of entitlement: I've done this; I deserve it; this is my chance. 
it | is there was | a sense of entitlement 
And I think part of it is there was a sense of entitlement: I've done this; I deserve it; this is my chance. 
I | 've done | this 
And I think part of it is there was a sense of entitlement: I've done this; I deserve it; this is my chance. 
I | deserve | it 
And I think part of it is there was a sense of entitlement: I've done this; I deserve it; this is my chance. 
this | is | my chance 
You | believe | he 
I | believe | he 
I | think | the campaign 
he | 's given | the campaign 
John McCain | would never have allowed | the past 
I | think | that 
McCain | said | that Reverend Wright 
the campaign | made | it 
I | wonder | there 
there | must be | a temptation 
Sarah Palin | brought | it 
she | talked | William Kristol 
they | 're going to bring up | Wright 
I | think | they 
I | think | there 
I | think | there 
us | play | independents 
who | might be looking | familiarity 
we | 've never had | a president 
we | 've had | Clintons and Washingtons and Jeffersons 
you | have to bring | the difference 
you | ca n't cross | that line 
you | 're | the diversity 
he | 's walking | a fine line 
I | think | there 
you | have | McCain 
there | is | a mixed message 
you | call | it 
I | would n't call | it 
I | 'd call | it 
that | is | control 
I | think | John's out 
I | think | Sarah Palin 
that | happens | many campaigns 
I | have | both 
you | have | an obligation 
We | worked | Ronald Reagan 
We | would never put | an ad 
we | 're | his signature 
I | do n't think | they 
I | want to ask | you 
something | which | you 
I | think | you 
I | saw | you 
I | 've never actually quoted | The Colbert Report 
you | said | something 
you | said | something 
the final months of a campaign | are | the beginning of the way someone rules 
what | does | say 
he | manages to win | this 
I | know | Ed 
he | does manage to win | this 
I | think | these months 
I | think | the months 
the election | are | the ramp 
people | form | impressions 
that | have | great weight 
you | become | president 
you | have to win | a mandate 
it | 's lunched | one idea 
at least | has been | a theme 
I | think | this 
I | think | will 
he | does manage to pull | this out 
there | 's going to be | a narrative 
they | 're going to be | a lot 
I | think | it 
I | think | his campaign 
I | think | Obama's campaign 
he | wants | it
