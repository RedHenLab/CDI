Tropical Storm Hanna | is barreling | the U.S. tonight 
its outer bands | already pounding | the Carolina coast 
Storm watchers | are posted tonight as far north | Massachusetts 
we | 're going to hear | a moment 
the storm | is headed why | another storm 
us | check | David Mattingly 
He | is | Myrtle Beach 
what | is | the situation 
we | have literally been drowning | Hanna 
the waves | got | our electronic equipment 
we | had | us 
I | 'm just going to talk | the dark 
We | 're expecting | flooding 
About 150,000 tourists | were | the hotel 
a lot of those tourists | voluntarily decided to go | home 
there | 's going to be | a big economic impact 
we | 're just absolutely getting hammered | wind and rain 
we | lost | David's 
he | lost | his electricity right 
that | was | his live report 
Hanna | is going to be | a rain maker 
we | 've already had | 4 inches 
they | make | those Pawleys Island hammocks 
the rain | is going to continue | all night 
we | have | you 
the graphic | is going to show | you 
the rain | 's going to move | North Carolina 
we | believe | the center of the storm 
This | is | Hanna 
Have | had | a gust 
we | 're really concerned | about is Ike 
us | take | you 
what | 's happening | Hanna 
That | 's | a straight line 
It | ca n't seem to make | its mind 
That | is | the forecast cone 
it | 's even | the cone 
It | 's going to have to wobble back | the right 
I | do think | that 
it | will make | landfall 
Landfall | is going to be | a relative term 
there | is | an eye 
it | 's trying to make | one 
I | think | we 
winds | to | 75 miles 
that | will be | that Category 1 hurricane level 
we | 've had | some gusts 
you | see now | some gusts 
We | could see | those same gusts 
the next story | is where | it 
the northeast | will make | a kind of a landfall 
I | know | it 
it | 's | a hurricane 
you | can do | some damage 
You | do n't want to have | a storm 
the next storm | is | Ike 
this | has already been | a big storm 
it | 's going to be | a very large , dangerous Category 3 
the gray cone | is | all the way 
I | ca n't believe | they 
That | is | many days 
We | 're going to have | more 
we | 're going to be | our next hour 
We | 're going to look | the investigation 
you | 'll hear | the man 
He | responds | the accusations 
she | became | governor 
Sarah Palin | told | police 
she | had listened | the phone 
Trooper Wooten | raged | her sister
