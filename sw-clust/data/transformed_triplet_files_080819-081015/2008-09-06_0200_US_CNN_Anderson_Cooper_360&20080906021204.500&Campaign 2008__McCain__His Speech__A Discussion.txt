( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ) | > | > MCCAIN 
I | ca n't wait to introduce | her 
D.C. ( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ) | > | > COOPER 
they | head | a rally 
McCain | has | a mantra 
he | says | he 
It | is | a theme 
he | used | last night's acceptance speech 
we | did | Senator Obama's acceptance speech 
we | want to take | a moment 
Rhetoric | is | one thing 
Tom Foreman | Keeping | Them Honest 
Senator McCain | made | bold claims 
he | will do | what Barack Obama 
let | 's put | them 
My tax cuts | will create | jobs 
His tax increases | will eliminate | them 
( AUDIENCE BOOS | > | > FOREMAN 
both men | are proposing to continue | tax cuts 
a think tank | staffed | people 
each candidate's plan | could drive | the deficit 
Obama | would not continue | tax cuts 
he | considers | wealthy people 
which plan | would create or destroy | more jobs 
( APPLAUSE ) | > | > MCCAIN 
Senator Obama | thinks | we 
Obama | has always said | nuclear power 
he | has opposed | offshore drilling 
he | included | expanded drilling 
he | does call | great caution 
I | fought | the right strategy 
it | was | the popular thing 
( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ) | > | > MCCAIN 
it | rescued | us 
that | would have demoralized | our military 
McCain | supported | the war 
it | was | political poison 
He | pushed | the troop surge 
there | is | way 
Military analysts | argue | how much credit 
most | say | it 
McCain | may have exaggerated | a bit 
the U.S. | had already pulled out | Iraq 
the result | be | a greater threat 
world public opinion of America | has grown | the Iraq war 
the war | has quelled or spurred | more terrorism 
John McCain's bold gamble | to pick | Sarah Palin 
we | do n't even know | this point 
We | 're already seeing | the campaign trail 
us | talk | strategy 
who | has advised | several presidents 
this | is | basically day one of a whole new race 
> > | ED | ROLLINS 
she | has turned | this whole 
This | is | a completely different race 
it | was | a week 
we | were talking | the Biden choice 
Biden | is | totally irrelevant today 
he | would have picked | Hillary Clinton 
many of us | thought | he 
he | could n't have picked | her 
She | has changed | the dynamics of this race 
It | is now | a dead-even race 
we | have got | eight weeks of a real battle 
( LAUGHTER ) | > | > COOPER 
you | agree | Ed 
Barack Obama | try to get | the momentum 
Richard Nixon | picked | Spiro Agnew 
the Democrats | attacked | Agnew 
( LAUGHTER ) | > | > BEGALA 
It | is | John McCain 
they | need to be going | McCain 
they | let | him 
he | has got | 169 lobbyists 
Barack Obama | has | zero 
McCain | is | a maverick reformer 
I | 'm | a Hasidic diamond merchant 
( LAUGHTER ) | > | > COOPER 
CROSSTALK) ( LAUGHTER ) | > | > COOPER 
what | is | the best use of Sarah Palin 
this campaign | is | about the two candidates 
I | think | it 
he | is | a maverick 
many | view | him 
you | are going to hear | rhetoric 
you | look | his record 
you | look | the things 
John McCain | has done | attempts 
his nomination speech | to talk | bipartisanship 
many | would see | that 
that | is | something 
that | shows | he 
this | is | the type of president 
some | would say | it 
it | is | a criticism of President Bush 
many | have criticized | President Bush 
it | does bear | she 
the trend | go | even her own party 
OK | > | WALL 
you | could argue | he 
he | is | a maverick 
a politician | saying | they 
the aisle | does n't make | you 
he | was supposed to be | a uniter 
I | 'm | that 
LAUGHTER ) | > | > GERGEN 
it | sounded | there 
who | were | that idea 
they | were really dissing | the other side 
That | did not exactly sound | we 
Sarah Palin | get used | in 
she | do | separate appearances 
they | stuck | the hip 
I | do n't think | they 
I | think | she 
I | think | Ed Rollins 
She | has electrified | the base of this party 
She | is | John McCain 
He | seems to have | much more personal energy 
it | 's also electrifying | the Democratic Party 
many of them | are appalled | the idea of Sarah Palin 
they | 're giving | $ 10 million 
this | is going to be | a very rough-and-tumble , very competitive next 60 days 
both sides | are loaded | bear 
there | is | a much more energized American public 
People | are paying | more attention 
Sarah Palin | pulling | almost as many viewers 
We | are going to take | a break 
We | will have | more 
We | 're going to take | a closer look 
her persona | have certainly wowed | the Republicans 
we | have done | all the candidates 
we | want to look | her record 
We | are going to hear | some of the lawmakers 
she | has worked | Alaska
