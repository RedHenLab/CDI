I | championed | reform 
I | told | Congress 
I | told | Congress thanks 
Sarah Palin | has actually seemed to have stopped making | that claim 
We | 're going to watch | it 
weeks of reporters | pointing | she 
she | said | thanks 
she | took | the earmark money 
we | 're going to look | why Obama and Biden 
I | want to show | you 
Palin | had | no problem

That | is | the city of Ketchikan 
that | is | Gravina Island 
that | is where | the local airport 
you | have to take | the ferry 
It | takes | about ten minutes 
that | brings | us 
It | would have crossed | the 
they | needed | a road 
here | is | what 
the bridge | got | they 
They | 'd already signed | a contract 
they | built | it 
This | is | Gravina Island Highway 
It | runs | about three miles 
there | is | no one 
Many locals | call | it 
The Democratic mayor of Ketchikan | calls | it 
I | told | Congress thanks 
I | stopped | that Bridge 
she | did n't tell | Congress 
no thanks | spent | $ 26 million 
that | will not go | a bridge 
Weinstein | said | course 
the road | would have made | sense 
now locals and tourists | have to take | a ferry 
we | were | the road 
we | met | P.J. Murphy 
who | works | the island 
I | 'm | the toll collector 
I | wanted to see where | it 
What | do | you 
It | is | nice road 
It | is | a nice road 
It | is | a lot 
what | do you think | it 
Mayor Weinstein | came | us 
camera ) | ( | Who's 
I | are using | the road 
He | can joke | it 
he | says | earmark money 
what | could | Governor Palin 
she | says | she 
Governor Palin | have done | this case 
Governor Palin | could have stopped | construction of this road 
camera ) | ( | There 
That | is where | the bridge 
(voice-over | ) | We 
who | supported | the road 
we | contacted | Palin's former campaign coordinator 
he | had | a hard time 
you | think | it 
the Governor | had | no choice 
that | is why | the project 
camera ) | ( | It 
the Governor | would n't think | that 
The Governor | could | change 
That | had to be spent | the Gravina Road 
the Governor | had | no options 
she | have | stopped construction 
I | 'd have to look | that 
Stapleton | did get back | you 
Governor Palin | would not have allowed | the Gravina Road project 
the road | was already signed | she 
the Governor | was left | no viable alternative 
no one | seems to use | the non-existent bridge 
them | put | something 
they | have | the road 
something | to get | people 
that | connects | this road 
there | are | eight or nine bridge options 
There | 's been | no final decision 
I | to understand | that woman 
she | collect | any tolls 
She | collected | our toll 
we | got | the ferry 
she | is | the toll collector 
I | met | her
