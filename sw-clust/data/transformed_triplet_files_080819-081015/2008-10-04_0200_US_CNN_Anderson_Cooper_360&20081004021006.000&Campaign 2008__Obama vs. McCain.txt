Congress | took | today 
It | 's | a permanent solution 
we | can stop | the bleeding 
we | can start getting | our economy 
Senators Obama and McCain | saying | the bailout 
a bitter medicine | to try to save | the economy 
It | took | a lot of sweetening 
More than $ 100 billion | went | pork barrel projects 
the spending | included | a fortune 
It | seems | the bailout 
taxpayer money | to support | the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune 
this | might be | it 
The Wall Street rescue bill | is stuffed | about $ 110 billion 
old tax breaks | getting | a new lease 
producers of wooden arrows | designed | use 
you | might think | they 
They | gave | away $ 192 million 
this | is really brought | you 
that | are lobbying | this piece of legislation 
there | is | the whopping $ 3.3 billion 
who | do n't pay | income tax 
there | is even | something 
$ 478 million | to keep | more film and television production 
we | went | the Hill today 
we | found | a lot of people 
who | had | a big problem 
What | happens when | the next crisis 
Wall Street | wakes up | its celebration 
we | did | nothing 
it | goes up | today 
Congressman John Lewis | said | he 
they | have | some of their pet projects 
I | wanted | a -- 
I | do n't like | the idea 
They | were | a barrel 
they | were | wasting time 
It | is | a very unfortunate thing 
it | is | a part of the legislative process 
everyone | is scratching | their heads 
who | stuck | all 
That | would be | Senator Majority Leader Harry Reid 
He | takes | credit 
He | says | it 
there | is | the politics of it 
it | 's to get | someone's vote 
some | say | the so-called sweeteners 
I | get | the impression 
a lot of fiscal conservatives | are | it 
we | 're pretty much talking | tax cuts 
I | talked | to 
they | supported | part of the bill 
it | is | liberals and conservatives 
who | are | it 
Some | feel | they 
what | happens now | the campaign 
the race | take | a far more negative turn 
We | will talk | our panel 
we | will examine | the most important moments 
she | did n't answer | the questions 
We | have actually discovered | what 
we | will tell | you
