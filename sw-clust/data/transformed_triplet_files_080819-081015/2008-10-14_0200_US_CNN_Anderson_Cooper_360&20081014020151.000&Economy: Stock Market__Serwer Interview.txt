it | 's | a trend 
It | is just | a day 
me | tell | you 
we | had | a loss of 198 points 
a lot of people | thought | that 
there | was | the price of oil 
Exxon and Chevron | brought | the market 
It | was | 500 points 
It | 's called | a short squeeze 
It | is | people 
who | are betting | the market 
You | have to buy | stocks 
that | is | what 
We | have never | numbers 
we | had ever seen was | a 500-point gain 
there | were | a lot of things 
the governments | decided | they 
of | gave | hints 
it | was going to start spending | this $ 700 billion 
the British model | guaranteeing | bank loans 
that | was | another big deal 
A lot of these things | led | this kind of market charge 
we | had | today 
we | 're not even halfway made | what 
we | lost | the last couple of weeks 
we | are learning | more details 
the government | is going to announce | tomorrow 
What | are | we 
what | are | you 
There | are | four basic things 
me | show | you 
The first one | is | the government 
they | 're going to make | direct investments 
They | are going to invest | those banks 
they | 're going to get | stocks 
the Treasury | has been authorized to spend | the first $ 250 billion of this $ 700 billion bailout 
the president | going to give | them 
authority | to spend | another $ 100 billion 
they | can accelerate | the pace 
they | 're buying | these troubled assets 
we | 're going to get | the rules 
that bailout package | had | some provisions 
your company | gets | help 
golden parachutes | get | too much money 
We | 're going to get | details 
which | insures | your bank accounts 
non-interest- | bearing | accounts 
that | is | a pretty important thing 
who | are worried | this credit crisis 
we | 're hearing | news 
That | is up | 11 percent 
What | happens | tomorrow 
things | may be headed | what 
it | means | your bottom line 
" magazine | managing | editor Andy Serwer 
you | said | it 
What | do | you 
You | know when | the flight attendants 
there | is | no question 
that tomorrow | is going to be | another one of those days 
There | is | a couple things 
today | was | a bank holiday 
we | will get | the full response of more developments 
We | 're also going to be having | the president 
You | pointed out to just | me 
we | went | the air 
the U.S. government | is now going to be putting | banks 
which | is basically | what 
it | is | what 
the Europeans | are putting | their own banks 
we | trying to do | this 
the plan | looks | me 
it | is | $ 250 billion 
the Europeans | are throwing | the long ball 
They | 're throwing | $ 2.3 trillion 
we | 're only going to be doing | $ 250 billion 
they | 're spending | 10 times 
Some people | are suggesting | our plan 
this whole idea | injecting | money 
Paulson | wrote | a couple weeks 
I | think | it 
there | were | suggestions 
we | have seen | the Europeans 
we | should have headed | this thing 
that | may be | a bit of a red herring 
This | is | uncharted territory 
you | see | the focus 
There | are | those 
I | think | CNN's Fareed Zakaria 
gosh | knows | it 
there | 's going to be | a lot of people 
it | is | a dose of reality 
that | very badly needed | reality 
our economy | has been bloated | a long time 
this | is | a wakeup call 
I | think | we 
we | 're paying | the piper 
You | do n't want to say | we 
America | need to be thrown | work 
who | did | nothing 
you | look | a guy 
who | works | a factory 
who | borrowed | more 
he | loses | a job 
we | should n't be borrowing | as much 
People | should n't be floating | things 
their cars | sending | so much money 
it | is | a wakeup call 
the pain | hurts | people 
that | is | the worst 
Even people | looking | the stock market 
I | get | the stock market 
it | 's gone up | 1,000 points 
the reasons | being | the stock market 
they | were | Friday 
they | were | last year 
which | -- when | the market 
it | is | 9000 
You | buy | great companies 
these companies | are going to be around | a long time 
It | is | they 
they | were | a year 
it | is | they 
this | is | a great lesson 
you | sold | Friday 
you | would have looked | a sucker , right 
we | have had | so many people 
what | do you think | the new developments
