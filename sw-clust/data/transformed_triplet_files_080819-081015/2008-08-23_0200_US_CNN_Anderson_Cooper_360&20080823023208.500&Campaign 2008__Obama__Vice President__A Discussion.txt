Barack Obama | leaving | a restaurant 
He | had | dinner 
You | see | the daughters 
Senator Obama | spent | some time 
that | will go out | the Obama campaign 
any candidate | picks | a vice president 
we | try to figure | is 
it | impact | the race 
it | move | a state 
us | start | this perspective 
You | see | 13 electoral votes 
It | has been trending | recent days 
Obama | deciding not to pick | Tim Kaine 
That | is | a calculation 
He | thinks | he 
he | 's | the choice 
This | has been | a reliably red state 
it | been | Bayh 
this state | would have been | play 
The Obama campaign | says | it 
that | has been | presidential politics 
Joe Biden | is | the choice 
The leading indicators | are pointing | Joe Biden 
Delaware | is | way 
You | 'd have to pull | the map 
what | is | the value of a Joe Biden 
it | is | the big national picture 
it | is | Senator Biden 
he | is | a Catholic 
That | is | a key battleground state 
We | give | it 
it | is | a contested state 
They | believe | he 
which | has been | Republican 
the Democrats | want | it 
we | put | it 
The Republicans | have never won | the presidency 
The Democrats | trying to take | that one away 
that | is tonight | our strategy session 
focus | is | the jump ball 
that | change | the map 
we | over-think | these things 
We | spend | so much time 
we | 're going to move | McCain 
we | get | Obama 
it | is | an interesting race 
you | have | two guys 
McCain | will be | 72 
each | have | different things 
us | stay | Obama 
we | talked | Suzanne right 
I | want to follow | the point 
I | find | the whole convention stage craft 
I | think | a lot of these Democratic delegates 
he | did n't show | her 
We | were talking | Paul Begala 
Bill Clinton | to ask | him 
I | ca n't pick | you 
what | do you think | GLORIA BORGER 
I | think | it 
I | think | there 
I | 'm | the Obama campaign 
we | know planned | Hillary Clinton speaking 
this | is going to be | a big part of it 
the question | will be how much | the week 
that | is going to be | a big factor 
I | heard | Paul Begala's complaints 
I | think | Hillary Clinton 
Bill Clinton | has | a prominent speaking role 
Hillary Clinton's name | is going to be put | nomination 
there | was | some things 
the Clinton folks | wanted | they 
I | think | they 
We | understand | you 
they | do pick | an experienced vice presidential candidate 
it | were | a Tim Kaine 
it | might be | a different story 
they | ca n't control | the visual images 
the Obama campaign | has done | this 
they | ca n't control | what 
we | 're going to see and control | what 
that | will be | the wild card 
the media and others | play | that story line 
the Republicans | go | an ad 
Barack Obama | picked | a guy 
a few months | said | he 
we | see | vice presidents 
It | depends | who 
John McCain | were to pick | a Mitt Romney 
Mitt Romney | said | some things 
John McCain | said | some things 
my guess | is | you 
it | is | Senator Biden 
I | 've really seen | Senator Barack Obama 
We | 're going to have | a narrative 
This | is | a pretty tightly-kept process 
this | is | about as disciplined and 
I | 'll get | a lot of e- mails 
The Democrats | are usually | this 
I | think | we 
they | do n't call | him 
I | do n't want | this 
Those people | did not talk | it 
it | is | Joe Biden 
the most interesting thing | will be | Joe Biden 
I | talked | people 
who | say | they 
he | did n't mention | it 
it | will be | a different Joe Biden 
me | say | the YouTube clips 
they | knew | this pick 
they | realized | Biden 
They | know | this 
They | understand | this 
it | is | Biden 
A little more reporting | to do | a lot more drama 
I | think | it 
I | 've done | more than anybody 
I | intend to keep doing | everything 
the focus | tonight growing | one of her Senate colleagues 
CNN | has confirmed | Indiana Senator Evan Bayh 
Virginia Governor Tim Kaine | have been told | they 
Evan | was | this 
He | understands | what 
we | 've learned | the former Democratic frontrunner 
that | is | a snub 
there | are | fears 
party unity | may be | just a pipe dream 
us | get | the latest 
You | are | fact Hillary Clinton 
you | played | a little bit of it 
it | was really | a story 
that | appeared | today 
people | listened | her 
she | was campaigning | Obama 
they | did n't really believe | she 
There | are | the conspiracy theorists 
that | believe | she 
There | is | probably no way 
Hillary Clinton | can win | this 
It | may be | fact 
people | are going to doubt | she 
This | happens when | one candidate 
they | 've been | the past several months 
we | know | Hillary Clinton 
this point | is | it 
she | will be | the pick 
I | know | the Obama campaign 
they | were talking | they 
they | were talking | they 
he | was speaking | he 
It | is | a matter of public record 
who | funded | his library 
Hillary Clinton | helped raise | some of those funds 
there | were | lots of details 
We | do have | others 
We | do know | Chet Edwards 
Jack Reed of Rhode Island | was | another one 
there | are | others 
we | have yet | kind of take 
we | are looking | Biden 
he | would endorse | whoever 
that | should also help | the relationship 
which | has been | today 
we | await now | the official word 
all night | waiting | that 
He | lives | half a world
