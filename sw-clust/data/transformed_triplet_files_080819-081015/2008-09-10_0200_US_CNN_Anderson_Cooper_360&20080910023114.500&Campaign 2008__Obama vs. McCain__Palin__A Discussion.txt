The latest Research poll | tells | the story of Barack Obama 
the GOP | is banking | Sarah Palin 
She | 's clearly energized | the conservative base 
it | is | you 
I | guess | she 
some sort of intensive study course | to deal | reporters 
Charlie Gibson | has | the first interview 
Thursday | spread | several days 
she | ever going | campaign 
she | 'll | campaign 
She | 's doing | a welcome-home rally 
we | 'll see | what 
her schedule | is | that 
I | think | the important thing 
they | need | this cycle 
The cycle | is | the press 
the other three figures | are | pretty familiar figures 
She | is | the new story 
I | think | the Obama campaign's point of view 
she | does | the interview 
they | need | this National Service Forum 
Obama and McCain | are doing here | New York 
They | need | some big event 
it | wo n't happen | the debates 
they | need | something 
the dynamic | is | What 
all | think | Sarah Palin 
Sarah Palin | has not talked | reporters 
I | think | it 
they | do n't think | she 
I | think | that 
they | thought | she 
I | 'm assuming | they 
I | am assuming | they 
a little more | groomed | this 
they | 're taking | a calculated risk 
I | do n't think | people 
Sarah Palin | going to talk | the media 
I | think once | she 
it | does | matter 
what | happens | that 
she | give | that one interview 
she | will be | campaigning 
you | look | her career 
mayor | running | Governor 
there | is | an awful lot of people 
who | have underestimated | Sarah Palin 
we | talked | it 
this | was | an enormous risk 
I | think | the McCain campaign 
that | is | Sarah Palin 
they | 've kept | it 
they | 're letting | her 
they | 've scheduled | it 
her son | is shipping | Iraq 
that | was | a 
that | was | a shrewd move 
it | 's going to influence | the way 
what's | shown | first day 
they | 're doing | this 
I | disagree | Candy 
I | think | people 
I | think | people 
she | is out | the trail 
she | 's been giving | essentially a reprise of the convention speech 
She | 's not answering | questions 
she | 's been so shielded | the press 
It | does undercut | her stature 
I | bet | she 
people | expect | who 
she | is | a pretty feisty woman 
That | is | one of the things 
that | 's won | her 
I | think | this 
I | do n't remember | any vice 
somebody | can correct | me 
I | cannot remember | a vice-presidential candidate 
who | has had | this long a span 
I | think | it 
she | starts | this and 
there | are | continuing interviews 
this | is no longer | a problem 
she | ca n't face | Wolf Blitzer 
she | face | Yeltsin 
Wolf Blitzer | said | you 
I | think | part of the 
the McCain campaign | is effectively pursuing | is 
they | 're continuing to do | it 
They | know | reporters 
she | 's not going | THE SITUATION ROOM" 
I | do n't think | it 
it | makes | a lot of Republicans happy 
it | up immediately | a narrative 
the press | is being | her 
she | justify | it 
I | think now | they 
her relatively | sequestered for most | the remaining days 
I | do n't believe | that 
I | think | this 
it | is | one thing 
you | 're going to play | the big leagues 
she | 's going to be | the White House 
there | 's got to be | a sense of readiness 
I | think | they 
What | is | that
