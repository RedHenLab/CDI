this rescue package | works exactly | it 
it | is only | the beginning 
it | 's | the end 
we | have | 150,000 new people 
who | 've lost | their jobs 
We | can go backward | job-killing tax hikes 
Senator Obama | would have | us 
we | can bring | real reform 
McCain | is scaling back | his political operation 
what | was | a battleground state 
the unemployment rate | is | 8.9 percent right 
we | said | the top 
> > | ED | HENRY 
John McCain | might be expected to enjoy | a victory lap 
he | avoided | any celebration 
This | is | a tourniquet 
It | 's | a cure 
It | 's | a cure 
it | is | a tourniquet 
It | will stop | the bleeding 
we | do | business 
( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ) | > | > HENRY 
The same metaphor | used | Barack Obama 
we | can stop | the bleeding 
this package | implement | it 
we | can start getting | our economy 
Both men | supported | the rescue 
It | 's seen | a bailout of fat cats 
it | was signed | law 
the government | revealed | another 159,000 jobs 
There | was | a jobs report 
that | came | today 
that | is | terrible news 
I | have to give | you 
I | ca n't give | you 
McCain | needs to stop | the bleeding 
Obama | is edging ahead | key battlegrounds 
he | links | McCain 
This failed philosophy | is | what 
John McCain | has embraced | the last 26 years 
He | has n't been getting | Wall Street 
( LAUGHTER ) | > | > HENRY 
that Republicans | have had | a lock 
Obama | has inched ahead | four points 
McCain | has decided to go | offense 
MCCAIN CAMPAIGN AD | > | > NARRATOR 
Senator Obama | voted | 94 times 
He | 's | taxes 
CNN | has done | a fact-check of McCain's charge 
Many of the 94 votes | were | budget votes 
that | would not have directly raised | tax 
McCain | is vowing to hit | the issue 
You | 're going to learn | a lot 
who | is | the liberal and 
who | is | the conservative 
who | wants to raise | your taxes 
who | wants to lower | them 
( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ) | > | > HENRY 
That face-off | will be | one of McCain's final chances 
that | is tilting | him 
us | dig | deeper 
the focus | is still going to be | the economy 
McCain | gain | any 
He | 's pushing | a big , great big boulder 
That | has bolstered | him 
the economy | is caught | this grip 
it | 's not going to go away | this bailout plan passage 
Wall Street | believe | another 100,000 jobs 
There | are | more job losses 
The economy | seems to be going deeper | recession 
there | is | just no way 
the economy | is going to go away | an issue 
the economy | is | Barack Obama 
Tuesday night | has become | him 
It | is | a good format 
It | is | a much more town hall-ish kind of format 
he | has got to hammer away | Obama 
he | did go | him 
I | guess | that 
There | is | some 30-odd days 
all the stops | > | CANDY CROWLEY 
I | do n't see | any reason 
it | 's going to be | any different 
it | happens | the last 30 days 
it | goes according | previous campaigns 
both of them | will come | with positive ads 
sort | to leave | voters 
I | think | McCain 
he | has | a lot of negative ads 
Obama | has | the freedom 
the McCain campaign | is announcing | it 
We | have | a recent poll of polls 
which | shows | Obama 
McCain | is hoping to turn | New Hampshire red 
we | did | a poll 
the results | were revealed | yesterday 
Obama | is | 12 points 
He | 's had | significant movement 
who | are | McCain's base 
it | is | a real uphill battle 
it | is | only four electoral votes 
they | had known | what 
they | would n't have pulled out | Michigan 
They | would have pulled | New Hampshire 
you | can drive | the street 
we | 're going to have | a lot
