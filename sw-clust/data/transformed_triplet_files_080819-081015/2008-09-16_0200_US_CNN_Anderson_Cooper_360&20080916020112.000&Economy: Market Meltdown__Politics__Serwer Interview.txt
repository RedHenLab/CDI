about 48 hours | notice buying | Merrill Lynch 
they | were | seven years 
each | weighing | what 
the latest financial earthquake | rumbled | Wall Street 
tremors | were rattling | the campaign trail 
Barack Obama | called | it

that | have shredded | consumer protections 
that | have loosened | oversight and regulation 
The result | is | the most serious financial crisis 
John McCain | blamed | big business and bad government 
People | are frightened | these events

Our economy | is | risk 
no doubt | how | serious this

A lot of people | may lose | their jobs 
this | is | all over 
It | 's | Wall Street
