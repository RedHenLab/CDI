investors | start digesting | plans 
bailout financial institutions | get | frozen credit markets 
us | dig | deeper 
thanks | being | us 
The administration's bailout plan | seems | kind of change 
you | explain | what 
we | hope | it 
banks | hope | they 
that | is | the hardest 
banks | to actually move | it 
they | get | it 
it | is | one step 
The next | is actually getting | it 
which | has not been happening | the last three weeks 
I | 've been following | it 
I | find | it 
I | 'm | a huge fan of your work 
What | do | you 
there | is | a lot of folks 
what | do you think | what 
you | heard | today 
you | see happening | the next few weeks 
I | think | this 
this | is largely | a psychological crisis 
Main Street | do n't trust | their banks 
They | 're pulling | cash out 
Wall Street bankers | do n't trust | each other 
They | wo n't loan | money 
We | have to break | this paralysis 
It | is | a heart-attack victim 
that | has to be shocked back | heart beating 
we | 've just got to keep shocking | it 
This | is | another step 
I | think | people 
it | 's been raised | $ 250,000 
I | want to play | something 
Secretary Paulson | said | his speech today 
We | expect | all participating banks 
their efforts | to help struggling | homeowners 
who | can afford | their homes 
Foreclosures | not only hurt | the families 
who | lose | their homes 
they | hurt | neighborhoods 
n't this | give | the government control 
we | 're | that 
We | 're | that process 
the government | has taken | a big ownership role 
this | is | a big step 
I | use | the " S" word 
this | is | a socialist doctrine 
many of them | were entirely owned | the government 
This | is | a whole different approach 
there | is | nothing 
WE | can take | the stakes 
It | happened | the Depression 
Jim | have said | the administration 
What | do | you 
I | think | what 
we | are | sort of one block 
I | watched | the Chicago marathon 
It | is | a long way 
I | think | this 
the bad news | is | we 
that | is | recession 
The last three weeks | have added | insult 
we | 've really seen | things 
I | 've ever seen | my career 
the ground | is moving literally | day-by-day 
the ground | is deteriorating | us 
We | saw | people 
who | could n't get | auto loans 
who | had | 800 score 
We | saw | home equity lines of credit 
banks | were n't providing | this credit 
we | 've still got to deal | the backdrop of a deteriorating economy 
We | 've been losing | jobs 
We | 're going to lose | more jobs 
I | think | we 
the Fed | to ease | more moves 
This | is | a global problem 
I | will say | that 
we | do have | a sound banking system 
we | 've seen | a seismic shift 
who | 's going to have | what 
We | had | Ben Bernanke 
this | is | a much more holistic , systemic approach 
It | 's only | the U.S. 
We | 've got | the whole world 
I | think | that 
I | read | the " Wall Street Journal of yours last week 
you | are very regimented | you 
everybody | says | that 
Almost | follow | it 
You | cut | the price 50 percent and people 
I | do n't want | it 
I | want | more of that 
Stocks | are | the strangest thing 
it | is | > COOPER 
you | own | goes 
I | take | profit 
I | was | a cocktail party 
It | is | they 
I | was | another planet 
I | appreciate having | you 
we | 'll look to have | you
