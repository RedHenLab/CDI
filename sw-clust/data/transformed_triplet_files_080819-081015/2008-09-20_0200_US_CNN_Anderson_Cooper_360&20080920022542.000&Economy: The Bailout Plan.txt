the entire campaign | saying | I 
I | think | it 
Senator McCain | is | a little panicked 
( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ) | > | > COOPER 
Senator Obama today | hitting hard | his opponent's statements 
That | is | our breaking news tonight 
the White House | has sent | its bank rescue plan 
each | have | their own economic vision 
these candidates | have | a grip 
I | think | it 
you | have got | the secretary of the treasury 
this | is | a super-delicate time 
I | thought | Barack Obama 
I | have got | some visions 
I | have got | some principles 
We | want to protect | Main Street 
he | has been hitting | McCain 
he | pulled back | a little bit today 
it | became | last night 
there | was going to be | a specific proposal 
that | was going to go | Congress 
I | think | he 
sort of | was trying to play | catchup 
he | did n't want to make | that same concession 
you | see | this having 
> > | ED | ROLLINS 
it | gives | Obama 
it | should be | his issue 
he | has n't caught | it 
it | should be | his issue 
the two candidates | understand | it 
I | hope | the administration 
This | is | their watch 
what | scares | me 
this | is | they 
they | claim | they 
my 40 years | being | Washington 
they | rush | a bill 
they | put | something 
you | end | with something 
you | have | no idea 
much | is being driven | the politicians 
much | is being driven | the financial experts 
who | are actually running | it 
political decisions | are driving | this thing 
I | think | it 
Ben Bernanke | are | charge 
who | are | the chairmen of the House and Senate Banking Committee 
They | 're waiting | this proposal 
we | take | what 
they | give | us 
that | is | a decision 
I | have been listening | other programs 
each side | bickering | each other and yelling 
it | did | even last week 
kind | do n't want to hear | that stuff 
kind of want | to hear how | it 
that | reflected | what 
you | 're seeing | the campaign trail 
the tone | changed when | you 
them | come out | that meeting 
you | heard | Senator Schumer 
it | was | that meeting 
I | think | it 
which | is | you 
I | think | they 
of | got | the gravity of this 
it | was explained | them 
it | has changed | it 
The Democrats | did not want | a lot of plans 
us | do | this 
us | do | that 
guys | bring | us 
that | is exactly | what's happening 
you | saw | Obama 
there | 's been | some shifting 
I | want to just get | your thoughts 
us | take | the map 
us | start | with Missouri 
It | had been considered | a tossup 
CNN | is now describing | it 
it | had been leaning | Obama 
CNN | is now calling | a tossup 
That | goes | lean Obama 
any of this | > | CROWLEY 
a lot of it | surprises | me 
I | think | Missouri 
it | is | a fairly conservative state 
we | do n't see | a lot of difference 
I | think | those 
you | say | it 
You | believe | Ohio 
What | do you think | it 
? | > | ROSEN 
I | think | it 
you | get | Florida 
you | do n't need | all of those other states 
I | think | the way 
they | 've worked very hard | the Obama campaign 
you | know | this better 
it | is | all 
you | put | your resources 
he | loses | Florida 
There | is | no way 
we | can put | the combination 
You | can play | funny numbers 
Florida | is | a part of our coalition 
we | need | Florida 
We | need | Texas 
You | think | Florida 
I | think | Florida 
I | think | Michigan and Ohio 
I | think | the bottom line 
Obama | loses | Michigan 
we | lose | Ohio or Florida 
We | need to hold | Michigan and Pennsylvania 
we | need to pick | one of those others 
We | 're actually going to be talking | all of you 
Wall Street | ending | oil prices 
We | 'll tell | you 
what | to expect | we
