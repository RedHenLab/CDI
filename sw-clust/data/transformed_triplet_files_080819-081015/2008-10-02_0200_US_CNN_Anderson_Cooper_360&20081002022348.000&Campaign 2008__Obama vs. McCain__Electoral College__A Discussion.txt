John King | will be | the magic map 
You | 're looking | the electoral map 
the colors | are changing and moving closer | Barack Obama 
The latest Research polls | show | him 
it | is really | the states 
John King | breaks | it 
the map | is trending | Barack Obama 
I | 'm starting here | a map of the 2004 election 
I | want to make | this point 
George W. Bush | carried | it 
our poll | shows | 51 percent 
us | go | West 
our new poll | shows | Barack Obama 
This | was | a blue state 
Barack Obama | leading | here 54 percent 
Missouri | has been right | every presidential election 
Missouri | has voted | the winner 
we | have | this a dead heat 
McCain | was ahead | this state 
I | just mentioned were | red states 
It | translates | this 
you | need | 270 
We | have | Barack Obama 
John McCain | trailing | 189 
The gold states | are | the tossup 
it | is | a lot 
it | is | John McCain 
Barack Obama | won | Florida 
we | have | it 
he | is | the next president of the United States 
John McCain | has to keep | Florida 
you | look | the map 
it | comes | the Electoral College 
It | is | all 
voters | favor | Obama 
They | are | the most reliable voters 
who | are looking | their 401(k )s 
the Pew Center | says | this 
Barack Obama | has | a 51 percent 
That | is | a decent lead 
John McCain | led | those same voters 
The more those voters | closest | retirement 
they | have watched | this race 
they | have dramatically trended | Barack Obama 
us | bring | CNN senior political analyst 
you | look | that map 
it | has got to be | the McCain campaign 
the election | had been held | two weeks 
the election | were held | today 
we | have still got | four-plus weeks 
there | can be | a lot of twists and turn 
there | is | no doubt 
the way John McCain | responded | it 
John McCain | has got | an uphill fight 
who | have changed | their views 
a lot of those | were | the same people 
who | were calling | Capitol Hill 
the House | to pass | this bill 
they | 're seeing | their nest eggs 
there | are | some 
who | are telling | the McCain campaign 
they | should use | Reverend Wright 
they | should try to reverse | this trend 
McCain | to do | that 
there | is | time 
they | do have and try to switch | the subject 
the economy | is | the key issue 
43 percent of the voters | said | the economy 
Bill Clinton | became | president of the United States 
I | 'm | a leader 
I | have got | the experience 
You | can trust | me 
I | think | the question 
who | is | more of a risk 
you | look | the last two weeks 
John McCain | is actually | a risk 
That | is | his problem 
these numbers | shifted so dramatically | the last two weeks 
John McCain | would have won | this thing 
solid | is | this support 
we | should make | that crystal-clear 
it | is | the issue of the economy 
this plan | passes | the House 
which | is still | a big 
the markets | rally | the next couple of weeks 
we | will get back | the ground 
which | is | leadership 
There | is | no question 
you | asked | Gloria 
they | want | John McCain 
( LAUGHTER ) | > | > KING 
you | have watched | him 
he | is attacking | Barack Obama one day 
He | is being | Mr. Bipartisan 
he | was | Mr. Bipartisan 
television | are highly | the very same issue 
he | is calling | bipartisanship 
He | is doing | it 
He | is doing | it 
he | is attacking | Barack Obama 
we | 're going to talk more | Gloria and David 
We | want to get | your take 
the Senate tonight | approving | the bailout deal 
all | means | us 
Sarah Palin | speaking | the interview everyone 
she | told | Katie Couric
