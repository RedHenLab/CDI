THE PANEL | IS | > > COOPER 
We | 're back | our panel 
We | 're going to broaden | the discussion 
Paul Begala | joining | me 
Palin | was also asked | comments 
she | thinks | the U.S. 
us | listen | her response 
We | should n't second-guess | the state 
we | cannot ever afford to send | a message 
we | would allow | a second Holocaust 
Israel | has got to have | the opportunity 
the ability | to protect | itself 
They | are | our closest ally 
We | need | them 
they | need | us 
we | should n't second-guess | their effort 
You | do n't think | the United States 
its rights | to express | its position 
We | need to express | our rights 
You | said | them 
We | do n't have to second-guess | what 
their efforts | would be | they 
it | is | their country 
all of our best interests | to fight | a regime 
who | would seek to wipe | them 
It | is | me 
the good guys | are | this one 
The bad guys | are | the ones 
who | say | Israel 
a stinking corpse | should be wiped off | the face of the earth 
That | 's | good guy 
who | is saying | that 
who | would seek to protect | the good guys 
those | are | the good guys 
There | is | a lot of Democrats 
who | would suspect | they 
a vice-presidential debate | moving | Friday's debate 
you | think | that 
I | think | it 
I | think | you 
McCain | does n't show | tomorrow night 
I | think | the bottom line 
More people | are interested | this debate 
we | were talking | the break 
I | guess | Sarah Palin 
the convention | getting | people 
that | might have helped | John McCain 
You | 're saying | Paul 
you guys | were | both agreeing , 
They | want to just get | the day 
They | were heading | a convention 
They | love | Barack Obama 
they | wanted to get | Hillary Clinton voters 
she | is | a woman 
She | excites | our base 
it | worked | a day or two 
it | is | a choice 
They | have n't even thought | she 
he | makes | decisions 
You | know | what 
it | is always | the candidate 
It | is always | the candidate 
who | runs | the campaign 
You | run | a campaign 
the candidate | is | it 
It | is | the candidate 
I | think | it 
John McCain | is | somebody 
who | comes | a room 
he | comes | a room 
I | want to do | this 
I | want to do | that 
I | have | both managed campaigns 
You | 're | the lion tamer 
you | 're there | a little dinky chair 
you | 've got to keep | him 
They | can do | the best 
that | does n't mean | you 
they | use | Sarah 
they | use | Sarah Palin 
I | think | I 
I | 'd have | her 
I | would n't put | her 
I | 'll say | her 
She | bought | them 
That | is | a major , major contribution 
There | is | another contribution 
a lot of people | think | McCain 
she | is | a distraction 
who | dislikes | her 
she | is | a useful distraction 
I | wonder how much | the American public 
everyone | is worried | that 
Joe Biden | has had | his own series of gaffes 
we | have covered | this program many times
