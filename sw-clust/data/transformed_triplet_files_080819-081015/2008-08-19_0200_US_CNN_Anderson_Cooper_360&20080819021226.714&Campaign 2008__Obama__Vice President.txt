The New York Times | is reporting | he 
a piece | saying | John McCain 
We | will see | about that 
both | joining | me 
you | reported | a few minutes 
a V.P. announcement | expected | Obama later 
important | is timing | all of this 
timing | is | all 
they | want to roll | this convention 
They | want | a big buildup 
they | can dominate | the news cycle 
they | announce | this vice presidential candidate 
You | get | that first V.P. pick 
it | is | positive kind of press 
they | are timing | this just 
it | moves over | the Republicans 
they | are trying to get | a good seven , eight , nine , 10 days 
Obama | announces | his V.P. 
McCain | steal | his thunder 
he | play | it 
I | think | the idea 
Ohio | is | this hugely important swing state 
the polls | suggest | John McCain 
who | was | a little 
his birthday | takes | the story 
that | 's brought | a vice presidential candidate 
I | think | that 
I | think | the one thing 
that | is | sort of etiquette 
you | do n't do | your vice presidential candidate 
that | competes | the other guy's convention 
You | do n't do | it 
I | think | he 
I | think | it 
we | have been talking | all along 
I | think | we 
he | was | sort of the flavor 
it | seems to be | more Biden 
There | was | a time 
Kaine | was | the man 
very difficult | to tell | the three of those 
those three people | have been | the most talked about 
somebody | said | me 
( LAUGHTER ) | > | > CROWLEY 
that | is | it 
this | put | new pressure 
Obama | to pick | somebody 
the | -- | the resignation of President Musharraf today 
Pakistan | puts | even more pressure 
who | can help to balance | the 
John McCain | has | who 
who | would be | the better commander 
I | think | these recent international events 
just | came back | Georgia 
It | was | an interesting trip 
I | would be interested | Candy's view 
It | seems | me 
there | is | real premium 
Senator Obama | to come | with someone 
who | brings | some excitement 
this ticket | overcomes | the whole Hillary question and everything else 
Hillary | is | the picture 
I | think | it 
I | wonder | he 
who | is out there | the list 
some people | are speculating | Al Gore 
that | would inject | a huge amount of excitement 
LAUGHTER ) | > | > GERGEN 
I | do n't think | it 
I | do n't think | Al Gore 
he | could find | a surprise 
I | think | that 
I | 'm | Candy's review 
I | love | David 
I | think | he 
I | think | the Obama ticket 
the excitement | is | the top 
they | do n't need | any more juice 
he | 's going to have | that speech 
I | think | they 
itself | is | excitement 
those vice presidents | tend to go | into rural America and 
a handful | talking | points 
me | give | the counter 
it | has | a pretty good lock 
they | may go | somebody 
he | has got | a 
he | has got | a real chance 
It | seems | me 
that | would prompt | a campaign 
I | think | someone 
foreign policy experience | would help | a lot 
a surprise choice | would help | a lot 
I | vote | David's scenario 
I | would like | something
