We | have | real problems 
the American people | are looking | us 
We | will work | you 
we | will put | our country 
that | is | what 
this campaign | is | all about , change and reform 
( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ) | > | > MCCAIN 
I | have fought | corruption 
it | did n't matter | it 
the race | tightening | the last few days 
I | do n't want to talk | the lipstick story 
we | addressed | it 
It | has been | all 
Mark Whitaker of NBC | made | the point 
it | is still being discussed | two things 
he | called | hand-to-hand combat 
it | highlights | the question 
it | is still | worth talking 
I | think | it 
I | did n't think | we 
we | are | lipstick 
I | think | this 
the media | seems obsessed | Sarah Palin 
this | is | a sideshow 
the big problems | facing | the country 
automakers | are coming | Washington 
the government | taking | over Fannie Mae 
it | is trumping | everything 
I | do think | the McCain campaign 
It | is | their interests 
that | is spent | Sarah Palin 
one less day | spent | the issues 
It | is | their advantage 
they | will get | at least two more nights 
Sarah Palin | giving | an interview 
they | will try to stretch | the interest 
me | tell | you 
there | are | Democrats 
Barack Obama | is | kind 
I | said | a Democrat 
what | would you have | him 
you | know | what 
The other side | can talk | whatever 
I | 'm talking | issues 
it | is | you 
this | is | a fight 
John McCain | wants to talk | Barack Obama's inexperience 
the Democrats | want | him 
they | believe | the issues 
they | are struggling | the conversation 
there | have been | Democrats 
who | have said | me 
you | know | what 
I | 'm going to talk | what 
you | want | me 
I | 'm hearing | just people 
there | is | this sort 
this | is no longer | what 
it | is | just kind of a lot 
you | are hearing | voters 
It | makes | both of them politicians 
What | was | the charm of Barack Obama 
He | was | new and different 
He | was | a traditional politician 
you | talk to | people 
I | was | Iowa 
they | are now looking | the ticket 
McCain | did | something 
they | wo n't go | camera 
they | would n't go | camera today 
they | are pulling | their hair out 
They | want | Barack Obama 
he | did n't address | it 
there | would be | some Democrats 
he | does n't have | the stomach 
They | ought to be taking | this fight 
He | needs to get back | jobs 
that | is why | he 
he | got | what 
it | takes to win | this 
what | is becoming | a very hard-fought race 
I | have to tell | you 
I | thought | he 
This | is | phony outrage 
us | get back | the issues 
he | has to make | the pivot 
I | thought | that 
he | was moving | the right direction 
Sarah Palin | get | the issues 
others | deal | the Sarah Palin question 
this | is | a very clever campaign 
I | must tell | you 
he | is outfoxing | the other side 
you | have to sort | say 
we | 're going to have to leave | it 
you | can see | McCain and Obama 
Coverage of the forum | starts | 8:00 Eastern 
We | will have | special coverage 
I | throw | the first punch 
I | throw | the last 
he | sounded off | what 
the pig | lipstick | remark 
Obama | says | Americans 
A new CNN poll | shows | it 
you | 're dealing | the economy 
we | are really talking | taxes 
McCain | says | Obama 
Obama | says | his challenger's tax breaks 
Who | is telling | the truth 
what | do | their actual plans 
us | clear up | the spin 
CNN's Joe Johns | joins | us 
polls | are suggesting | most Americans 
Barack Obama | will raise | taxes 
he | says | his plan 
what | is | the truth 
McCain | has | a simple message 
I | will cut | your taxes , period 
that | makes | him 
the Republicans | is | Obama 
What Obama | says | is 
he | would give | a tax cut 
who | make | more than $ 250,000 
Obama's plan | would allow | their taxes 
that side | is | the McCain plan 
just plain | helps | wealthy Americans 
The truth | is | McCain's plan 
the biggest tax cuts | would still go | the top wage-earners 
us | look | some real-world comparisons 
you | show | them 
the Obama plan | will cut | your taxes 
McCain | would give | you 
us | go up | an income bracket 
Obama | cuts | your taxes 
The big switch | starts happening | the upper brackets 
you | make | $ 227,000-$ 603,000 
the taxes | go | $ 12 
you | end up paying | Obama's plan 
you | get | a break of $ 7,871 
you | get | a break of just over $ 45,000 
We | have put | a link 
people | want to get | a closer look 
That | is | AC360.com 
You | can just follow | the links 
we | have got | new polls 
there | is | that whole lipstick business 
a lot | to cover | our " Strategy Session 
I | talked | CNN political contributor 
Obama today | accused | the McCain campaign of phony outrage 
( LAUGHTER ) | > | > COOPER 
he | being | he 
a question of aggressiveness | is | what 
the McCain campaign | gets up | every day 
we | distract | people 
what's | happened | their lives 
somebody | was going to think | something 
I | think | Senator Obama 
he | 's starting to do | some 
what | happened | the United States of America 
what | happened | people 
That | is | what 
the McCain people | get | they 
What kind of thing | can we use to distract | people's attention 
That | is | the key 
the McCain strategy | was when | they 
Obama | missed to bring | somebody 
that | will really excite | people 
that | is | change 
that | would reinforce | his message of change 
he | did | it 
he | did | it 
that | is | what 
that | is why | Obama 
I | have | no idea 
she | can do | anything 
we | 'll find | in due course 
McCain | has vowed to continue | the policies of this administration 
He | says | he 
Bush | agree | every single big thing 
We | have | a $ 407 billion budget deficit 
There | is | a story today 
I | know | this 
there | is | cozy relationship 
there | will be | some other thing 
what | happened | their country 
what | happened | their lives 
you | might want to tell | him 
he | 's been focused | Sarah 
He | has been driving | the argument 
I | welcome | that 
that | is | the 
You | cannot blame | McCain 
McCain | has run | a smart , wise campaign 
He | 's energized | his base 
He | 's got | excitement 
America | loves | Sarah Palin 
they | 're going to vote | the ticket 
I | 'd ask | folks 
I | think | I 
I | asked | you 
What | is | this election 
people | said | it 
it | 's going to be | an election 
it | seems to be | just kind 
what | 's going to decide | this 
you | have | momentum 
people | get | very much tense 
they | start saying | things 
that | is where | the nitpicking 
what McCain | decided | is 
the big issue | is | change 
I | 've been | Washington 
I | 've done | some 
I | 'm going to do | more 
I | 'm going to prove | it 
who | has | an incredible record 
Obama | has ever accomplished | his entire career 
She | has | a record of change 
that | is | what 
it | 's coming down | to 
Who | will make | a difference 
you | were advising | the McCain campaign 
you | allow ever | Sarah Palin 
it | is | the extent 
I | do n't know | any campaign 
presidential candidate | had yet to talk | a reporter 
she | 's going to talk | one 
I | understand | it 
I | think | she 
two days | talking | him 
She | 's going to talk | Charlie Gibson 
she | 's not taking | any questions 
she | 'll have | her 
this | is | the key 
you | change | your strategy 
You | do n't change | it 
I | agree | she 
She | 'll do | it 
which | gives | her 
She | 'll do | some others 
we | 're picking | votes 
we | 're not going to listen | the Obama campaign 
the media | change | our strategy 
I | like | that 
McCain | keeps insisting | the fundamentals 
He | has n't said | months 
I | 'll tell | you 
he | said | the fundamentals 
He | said | the fundamentals 
he | has n't proposed | a single things 
He | said | he 
George W. Bush | agree | every big thing 
That | is really | what 
change | do you want | more of the same
