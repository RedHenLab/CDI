We | have | real problems 
the American people | are looking | us 
We | will work | you 
we | will put | our country 
that | is | what 
this campaign | is | all about , change and reform 
( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ) | > | > MCCAIN 
I | have fought | corruption 
it | did n't matter | it 
the race | tightening | the last few days 
I | do n't want to talk | the lipstick story 
we | addressed | it 
It | has been | all 
Mark Whitaker of NBC | made | the point 
it | is still being discussed | two things 
he | called | hand-to-hand combat 
it | highlights | the question 
it | is still | worth talking 
I | think | it 
I | did n't think | we 
we | are | lipstick 
I | think | this 
the media | seems obsessed | Sarah Palin 
this | is | a sideshow 
the big problems | facing | the country 
automakers | are coming | Washington 
the government | taking | over Fannie Mae 
it | is trumping | everything 
I | do think | the McCain campaign 
It | is | their interests 
that | is spent | Sarah Palin 
one less day | spent | the issues 
It | is | their advantage 
they | will get | at least two more nights 
Sarah Palin | giving | an interview 
they | will try to stretch | the interest 
me | tell | you 
there | are | Democrats 
Barack Obama | is | kind 
I | said | a Democrat 
what | would you have | him 
you | know | what 
The other side | can talk | whatever 
I | 'm talking | issues 
it | is | you 
this | is | a fight 
John McCain | wants to talk | Barack Obama's inexperience 
the Democrats | want | him 
they | believe | the issues 
they | are struggling | the conversation 
there | have been | Democrats 
who | have said | me 
you | know | what 
I | 'm going to talk | what 
you | want | me 
I | 'm hearing | just people 
there | is | this sort 
this | is no longer | what 
it | is | just kind of a lot 
you | are hearing | voters 
It | makes | both of them politicians 
What | was | the charm of Barack Obama 
He | was | new and different 
He | was | a traditional politician 
you | talk to | people 
I | was | Iowa 
they | are now looking | the ticket 
McCain | did | something 
they | wo n't go | camera 
they | would n't go | camera today 
they | are pulling | their hair out 
They | want | Barack Obama 
he | did n't address | it 
there | would be | some Democrats 
he | does n't have | the stomach 
They | ought to be taking | this fight 
He | needs to get back | jobs 
that | is why | he 
he | got | what 
it | takes to win | this 
what | is becoming | a very hard-fought race 
I | have to tell | you 
I | thought | he 
This | is | phony outrage 
us | get back | the issues 
he | has to make | the pivot 
I | thought | that 
he | was moving | the right direction 
Sarah Palin | get | the issues 
others | deal | the Sarah Palin question 
this | is | a very clever campaign 
I | must tell | you 
he | is outfoxing | the other side 
you | have to sort | say 
we | 're going to have to leave | it 
you | can see | McCain and Obama 
Coverage of the forum | starts | 8:00 Eastern 
We | will have | special coverage 
their running mates | stand | abortion 
Palin's anti-choice position | has infused | enthusiasm 
We | 'll show | you 
her position | compares | Joe Biden's 
The answers | may actually kind | surprise 
Sarah Palin | is attacking | Obama 
what | is | her record
