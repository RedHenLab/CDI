we | have breaking | news 
CNN | has confirmed | Barack Obama 
we | know | Virginia Governor Tim Kaine 
there | are | other reports 
we | 're getting | information 
CNN | indicating | Indiana Senator Evan Bayh 
We | have just gotten | some new video of the Senator and Michelle Obama 
That | 's going | the restaurant 
reporters | shouting outside | this moment 
we | have now confirmed | this infamous , famous text message 
a senior Obama campaign source | telling | me 
text message | could come as early | 4:00 a.m. 
That | leaves | Delaware Senator Joe Biden 
some | are saying | the leading candidate 
you | can see | the 
We | have learned also | a flight 
Chicago's Midway Airport | has landed | New Castle 
It | is getting | a little silly 
the serious money | does seem to be | Senator Joe Biden 
the Obama campaign | is holding | real intrigue 
who | are | Obama's choice 
it | wo n't be | him 
Several former Clintonites | confirmed | the record 
she | was never vetted | Obama's number two 
you | want | the job 
I | have never said | I 
Reporters | staked | the home of the most frequently mentioned possibilities 
the news | ended up looking | a real estate show 
Chicago | had landed | New Castle 
Biden | has been dodging | cameras 
I | 'm | the guy 
Those potential candidates | to emerge | their homes today 
I | do n't really comment | my phone calls 
I | 'm probably | my son's little league ball games 
their lives | admit | the madness 
Indiana Evan Bayh | taking | his sons 
bumper stickers | were being printed | a political paraphernalia factory 
the plant | said | nothing 
We | had | four different signs 
We | had | confidentiality agreements 
we | had done enough planning to throw | people 
I | thought | we 
( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ) | > | > CROWLEY 
Campaigns | have played | this game 
It | is | just that Obama 
you | talked | a new name 
we | had n't heard | today 
it | is | real 
This | was | a Nancy Pelosi push 
She | pushed | him 
he | vet | him 
it | was | something 
we | know | he 
I | would suggest | he 
he | would n't be | a bad shot 
this | is | a man 
who | is | veterans 
He | 's done | a lot 
he | is | some good credentials 
I | would think | that 
he | would probably be | the longer shot 
you | 're comparing | him 
we | are getting | some feel 
we | starting to show | Candy 
I | got | a second source 
an e-mail | saying | Bayh 
We | 're trying to get | more sources 
it | does look | that way 
We | have | more confirmation 
Evan Bayh | has been told | he 
which | bring | me 
we | do n't have | this part 
all the signals | are sending | us 
Barack Obama | says | he 
Joe Biden | has been | a senator 
he | fit | the message 
> > | ED | ROLLINS 
who | does n't hurt | you 
who | helps | you 
I | think | Joe Biden 
I | think | he 
he | has served | the country 
I | think | he 
I | think | he 
it | 's | a choice 
It | does n't fill | the gaps 
that | are there | her supporters 
it | used to be | the ultimate barometer state 
you | won | Delaware 
you | would win | the presidency 
it | 's | much Missouri 
I | think | he 
people | will say | it 
I | want | you 
It | is | a two-part question 
what | would | Joe 
He | was born | Pennsylvania 
That | is | a place 
Barack Obama | had | problems 
Joe Biden | gets | you 
many | thought | Hillary Clinton 
who | voted | Senator Clinton 
they | be offended | the fact 
she | was not even vetted | the Obama campaign 
Senator Obama | said | Hillary Clinton 
there | are | some people 
who | will be | that convention 
who | will love | Joe Biden 
I | think | everybody 
that hall | will love | Joe Biden 
I | think | he 
he | would be | a terrific choice 
who | tend to be | a little more downscale 
Joe | is | all of those things 
I | think | he 
I | think | there 
You | said | you 
you | did n't even vet | her 
You | did n't call | her 
You | did n't seek | her advice 
he | did n't seek | President Clinton's advice 
He | is actually | the guy 
I | think picked | the best vice president 
You | would think maybe | you 
I | was going to go | the moon 
I | would call | Neil Armstrong 
He | 's done | it 
( LAUGHTER ) | > | > KING 
we | may be leaning | a little 
us | keep leaning | Biden's way 
Senator Obama | said | that interview 
he | wanted | somebody 
who | would challenge | him 
Senator Biden | challenged | him 
It | would be | a pretty big step 
it | would be | a big step 
Joe Biden | see | his comments 
It | reminds | me of the George Bush 
the father | talking | voodoo economics 
it | haunted | him 
you | pick | a former rival 
there | are | so many things 
Paul | alluded | to 
They | listed | his net worth 
he | is | Catholic 
he | will be | a very good attack dog 
He | will be | that role 
generally | is set aside | the vice presidential candidate 
he | has | a razor-sharp wit 
that | can just slice right | things 
it | is | something 
we | could get so surprised | this 
we | have talked | the various assets and deficits of the candidates 
there | is | a lot 
I | will bet | bottom dollar 
he | knows | how many houses 
( LAUGHTER ) | > | > KING 
I | want to remind | our viewers 
there | is | a reason 
we | 're talking | Joe Biden 
that | is | CNN 
they | are not going to be | his running mate 
which | is why | we 
us | continue | the conversation 
he | is | someone 
he | was | the debates 
he | was | the debates 
he | would be | a pretty good attack dog 
he | ran | president 
that | was | such a good campaign 
it | shows | he 
I | think | you 
I | think | he 
He | did n't get | very many delegates 
I | think | that 
he | constructed | this 
he | is | really one of the great orators 
we | 're | a treat 
He | constructed | the world of September 12 
he | were | president 
it | would have been | George W. Bush's 
It | appealed | unity 
it | appealed | energy independence 
Senator Obama | gave | a foreign policy speech 
the first third of that speech | read | a lot 
that | is when | I 
I | think | Barack 
it | is | a very good sign 
you | see | somebody 
you | have run | start 
that | shows | Senator Obama 
he | says | he 
who | will challenge | him 
we | need to leave | it 
We | will continue to check | with everyone 
we | continue | our reporting tonight 
the conversation | is | way 
just | go | our new Web site 
That | is where | you 
She | is | > KING 
that | is | a rare shot 
That | is | Senator Joe Biden's driveway 
CNN | has confirmed | both Tim Kaine 
Candy | said | the break 
he | is | a blue-collar senator 
He | takes | Amtrak 
He | has got | a class 
The dean | says | he 
he | make | an exception tomorrow 
the ticket | would bring | a great deal of experience 
John McCain | brings | the top of the GOP slate 
Barack Obama | could choose | a running mate 
who | reinforces | his message of change 
We | are going to fundamentally bring | about change 
Barack Obama | could choose | a running mate 
who | reinforces | his message of change 
We | are going to fundamentally bring | about change 
Women | are often seen | political outsiders 
Tim Kaine | got | this thing 
Obama's limited experience | seems to be | a weakness 
What process | would you use to pull | the experience 
He | could go | Senator Hillary Clinton 
who | 's been | Washington 
Joe Biden | has been | the Senate 
I | have joined | people 
Joe Biden | to increase | $ 1 billion of investment 
Obama | to do | both 
he | has | people 
The key | bringing | change 
Washington | is going to be to get | some good people 
Chet Edwards | has been | Congress 
He | is | a moderate Democrat 
who | supports | President Bush 
We | have had | a lot of disagreements 
he | is | President Bush's congressman 
Senator Obama | talks | a lot 
bipartisanship | ending | the partisan gridlock 
That | would be | a change 
that | was | the big question 
he | considered | his running mate 
We | 're getting | closer 
We | have | a lot of new clues
