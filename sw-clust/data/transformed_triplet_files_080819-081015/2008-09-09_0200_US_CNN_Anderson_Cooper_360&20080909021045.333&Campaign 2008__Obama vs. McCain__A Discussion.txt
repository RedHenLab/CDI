>> > | ACTIVE | TAXES 
I | will keep | taxes 
we | -- where | I 
My opponent | will raise | them 
I | will open | new markets 
My opponent | will close | them 
I | will cut | government spending 
He | will increase | it 
He | has | the most liberal voting record of anybody 
John | McCain | a straight face 
I | 'm going to change | things 
he | says | he 
all of it | making | news tonight 
us | talk | strategy and campaign tactics 
John McCain | is now saying | he 
Palin | are | the agents of change 
the change thing | make | this 
he | 's largely erased | Barack Obama's advantage 
He | has n't caught | him 
it | is | a much narrower margin 
I | do think | he 
Palin | have become | the story 
They | have | the momentum 
the express | has to slow | sort of fade 
Obama | has to take | it 
history | goes | both ways 
We | have had | a couple of times 
somebody | has surged ahead | their convention 
we | have also had | examples 
1980 | came out | a bounce 
Al Gore | came | a big bounce 
it | can go either way | this 
that | is | the drama of the next two or three weeks 
McCain | has | a surge 
he | hold | it 
David | said | it 
We | have | poll numbers 
that | shows how | McCain 
voters | think are going to bring | change 
us | put | those 
the Obama campaign | countering | it 
a plan | to counter | that 
someone | adopts | your message 
what | do | you 
you | heard | it 
You | try to grab | it 
That | was | Obama today 
It | was | all about 
This | is | change 
It | 's not change when | you 
It | 's not change when | you 
It | 's | change 
they | are hitting | this very hard 
you | heard | the lobbyists bite 
He | has | former lobbyists 
This | is | a campaign 
I | 'm | change 
this | was | the mantra 
they | know | the Obama campaign 
he | 's been | kind of usurp 
the | -- | the maverick thing 
it | clearly galls | them 
there | is | so much interest 
It | seems to go | facts 
you | look | facts 
she | says | she 
she | supported | it 
we | have | this video 
she | was running | governor 
She | was asked | she 
I | 'm not going to stand | the way of progress 
they | 're making | those efforts 
the state of Alaska | to build | our infrastructure 
I | would not get | the way of progress 
we | saw | her 
She | asked | more earmarks 
I | think | it 
our job | to point | the facts 
It | 's | our job 
she | hired | a consultant 
that | 's not disqualifying | her 
it | is | contradictory 
she | was | the mayor of the town 
she | was | mayor of Wasilla 
There | is | a tremendous amount of excitement 
she | is | such a novelty 
I | think | people 
these polls | deal | the immediate aftermath of the convention 
I | think | people 
we | will see | she 
it | go | sort of a cultural divide 
The Republicans | have very successfully reignited | the culture wars 
which | have been | sort of bubbling 
there | is | a quality 
There | was | an interesting piece 
a columnist | named | Clive Crook 
he | said | the 
the | -- | the Democrats 
they | pass | all these programs 
they | 're | a good number of Democrats 
they | do look down | them 
there | is | this kind of resentment factor 
you | 're | an evangelical 
there | was | a long period of time 
you | felt | you 
the Democrats | have to sort | think through 
I | think | Obama's trying 
you | show | respect 
who | are | you 
you | are | their side 
that | is | a big challenge 
which | are chiefly | abortion 
you | can do | this 
it | is | sort 
it | 's up | the big radar screen 
the suburbs | feel really frightened | it 
it | makes | a huge difference 
a lot of those people | were going to vote | Obama 
they | 're voting | 
They | want to put | yard signs 
That | is | what Karl Rove 
Obama | has got | this large army of people 
who | have been doing | this now 
they | 're doing | that pretty darn 
I | want ask | all of you 
Hillary Clinton | had been selected | vice president nominee 
Sarah Palin | would have gotten | the nod 
I | think | it 
I | think | she 
I | think | it 
it | is | the X-factor 
I | think | what 
he | had picked | a Clintonite 
I | think | he 
I | think | that 
We | 're going to leave | it
