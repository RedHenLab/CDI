We | were talking | change 
we | talked | change 
I | noticed | John McCain 
Senator Obama | has never taken | his party 
We | pushed | the reform 
ruffled feathers | angered | the entrenched interests 
I | was not elected | Ms. Congeniality 
( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) | > | > COOPER 
That | is how | it 
they | scramble to respond | the latest developments 
both | is convince | voters 
they | 're | the best man 
CNN's Candy Crowley | has | all the day's " Raw Politics 
the Wall Street mess | dominates | the headlines 
voters | blame | Republicans 
I | guess | they 
you | do n't have | much sense 
they | can stand | a straight face 
We | 're going to clean | it 
They | made | the mess 
( APPLAUSE ) | > | > OBAMA 
they | have been running | the government 
It | is | the underpinning of the Obama campaign 
a persistent attempt | to tie | John McCain 
McCain | needs to tell | voters 
he | has | the reformer credentials 
me | offer | a little advance warning 
Change | is coming | a neighborhood 
( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ) | > | > CROWLEY 
McCain | holds | a-12 point lead 
the question | is | about judgment 
Obama | is up | six points 
voters | are asked | judgment 
the issue | to dominate | the conversation 
Election Day | plays | Obama's perceived strength 
he | pushes | it 
We | need | a plan 
that | helps | families 
their homes and workers | keep | their jobs 
that | gives hardworking | Americans relief 
taxpayer dollars | to reward | CEOs 
( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ) | > | > CROWLEY 
The bailout | brings | a peculiar conundrum 
The candidates | do n't want to stand | the way 
they | do n't want to fully embrace | a plan 
that | seems to save | the elite 
both candidates | accept | the need 
they | speak | the resentment 
it | stirs | struggling taxpayers 
We | ca n't have | taxpayers 
We | need to put | our country 
It | is | the excess and greed 
( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ) | > | > MCCAIN 
that | got | us 
it | comes | the bailout 
Obama and McCain | agree | more than disagree 
Both | want | more oversight 
the money | is spent | limits 
Both | want to see | the final package 
it | seems | the Wall Street crisis 
the October surprise | come early | that 
it | seems | both candidates 
I | guess | you 
they | do n't want to do | anything 
the markets | get | blame 
neither | seems to be giving | a lot of specifics 
it | is | a 
it | is | a rare moment of prudence 
( LAUGHTER ) | > | > KLEIN 
that | is | the stakes 
this | is | a hugely complicated thing 
I | think | it 
all | want to go | home 
they | can | campaign 
I | think | it 
the next four days | to work | this one out 
both McCain and Obama | are trying | chip 
Obama | is trying to use | the natural advantage 
you | say | both sides 
he | initially sort of took | the Phil Gramm line 
we | have to sort | move 
sort | bounced | all week 
You | wo n't hear | line 
you | will not hear | line 
that | was | the bailout 
they | do n't control | this environment 
I | think | they 
I | think | some of it 
it | is | an international crisis 
they | have | their game plan 
we | ca n't make | decisions 
we | promised to do | the last year 
That | is | the thing 
they | 're still talking | all the plans 
stuff | is | the window 
We | 're talking | $ 700 billion here 
it | changes | the playing field 
we | may need to put | a lot of people 
I | do think | they 
I | think | Obama 
he | has | people 
John McCain | has essentially been | a deregulator 
I | want to get | Ed 
you | think | Obama 
we | asked | McCain 
I | want to bring in | Jennifer 
Obama | has | a 10-point lead 
it | comes | the economy 
that | is mainly | voters 
I | think | it 
I | think | you 
McCain | has made | some very serious mistakes 
it | happened | it 
the year | leading | up 
we | were | good economic circumstances 
McCain | was calling | the homeowners 
he | was | a deregulator 
who | is now having to favor | this legislation 
the voters | are demanding | it 
I | have | a tremendous amount of respect 
I | think | his campaign operatives 
that | is why | you 
it | 's allowing | Obama 
That | was | McCain's playbook 
Obama | is articulating | it 
he | has given | probably at least 
he | gave | more specifics 
he | would want overseeing | whatever 
he | talked | a Mike Bloomberg 
he | talked | Warren Buffett 
he | talked | Mitt Romney 
What | do | you 
Obama | should have used | his role 
He | should have sat | the leadership of his party 
he | is | the guy 
he | wins | this thing 
he | has got to make | it 
You | have not seen | any presence 
You | have not seen | him 
He | should have called | a meeting 
he | would have looked | a leader 
The other side is, the first guy that steps up here and says, "Listen, I don't know what I can do; we're in a crisis; what I'm -- what I'm talking about is leadership, and part of leadership is being honest with the American public," I think that will give whoever does that a real advantage. 
I | do n't know | what

we | 're | a crisis

I | 'm talking | is leadership

part of leadership | is being | the American public

I | think | that

whoever | does | a real advantage 
It | does seem | that 
the world | has changed | three weeks 
them | to still be talking | all the programs 
the money | may seem | less 
Pick two | > | KLEIN 
They | 're | the heat of a political campaign 
Republicans | are n't going to abandon | McCain 
I | do n't agree | that 
I | have got to jump | there 
I | think | McCain 
a real problem | solidifying | his base 
that | is | part of what 
I | think | we 
that | 's | a Christmas tree 
that | 's | John McCain 
You | know | John McCain 
I | know | John McCain 
that | 's | John McCain 
I | think | he 
I | think | he 
Republicans | do n't want to vote | Barack Obama 
who | is | part of the Republican leadership 
that | is just | the wrong signal 
You | need | base 
part of what | is happening | is 
young voters | are registering | bigger numbers 
I | saw | it 
I | want | Ed 
McCain | has | an advantage 
whoever | gets | the independents 
we | 're going to leave | it 
the blame game | heating | up 
Both candidates | accusing | each other 
who | 's telling | the truth
