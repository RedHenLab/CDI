Senator Obama | will try to distract | you 
he | answers | a serious and legitimate questions 
I | have | a debate tomorrow 
who | 's going to be | the next president 
Both men | gearing | for tomorrow's debate 
Round two | will be | a town-hall 
You | can watch | it 
We | have | two new polls 
The latest Research poll | gives | Obama 
That | is double | the amount 
which | is | a survey of several polls 
those | are | the only numbers 
Candy Crowley | has | the " Raw Politics 
Barack Obama | sails | Tuesday day night's debate 
Obama's ability | to handle | a financial crisis 
who | say | the economy 
He | would really have to blow | the debate 
This | is | a television show 
I | do think | the style points 
image points | become | presidential debates 
a watch | can signal | disinterest 
This debate | is | a town hall meeting 
Barack Obama | has done | hundreds of them 
it | 's always | his best forum 
One New Hampshire supporter | described | a myriad health problems 
which | forced | her husband 
the only way | to get | insurance 
He | is going | to war 
he | can provide | a living 
I | wish | your story 
His numbers | falling | the days disappear 
John McCain | has | the most 
He | is | a master 
the Obama campaign | has been busily jacking | the stakes 
the senator | can be | what 
he | claims | is humor 
you | might die | office 
both | need to watch | it 
They | are | the midst of a nasty season 
It | may work | short sound bites 
front | adoring | crowds 
it | does not work | the course of an hour and half 
It | does not work | uncommitted voters 
Victory | may go | the candidate 
who | keeps | his cool 
Palin | has really been attacking | Obama 
McCain | implying | Obama 
What | happens | tomorrow 
we | know | what 
the McCain campaign | has to do | both 
It | has to keep casting | those doubts 
It | is | a lot 
definitely | is | something 
he | understands | the middle class 
he | understands | what 
they | 're going through | he 
We | 're going to look | more 
He | is slipping | the polls 
he | do | tomorrow
