We | are going to bring | you 
we | 're doing | any new developments 
we | have | correspondents 
we | do want to give | you 
her first | becoming | the Republican vice presidential candidate 
she | spoke again | ABC's Charlie Gibson 
Palin's answers | are providing | ample ammunition 
Our panel | weighs | the break 
ABC NEWS | > | CHARLES GIBSON 
You | said | you 
$ 3.2 million | researching | the genetics of harbor seals 
money | to study | the mating habits of crabs 
John McCain | is objecting | ? > > 
those research requests | did come | that system 
it | to be | the light of day 
lobbyists | making | deals 
Congress | to stick | things 
that | is | the abuse 
you | think | it 
I | think | it 
I | think | states 
I | do respect | other people's opinion 
I | think | a culture of life 
who | are | the other side of this issue 
I | know | we 
That | is | my personal opinion 
John McCain | would allow | abortion 
you | believe | it 
That | is | my personal opinion 
you | change and accept | it 
My personal opinion | is | abortion 
I | do understand | McCain's position 
I | do understand | others 
who | are | this issue 
who | have | a differing view 
I | 'm | a family 
I | 'm not going to judge | someone 
they | believe | homosexuality 
I | 'm not going to judge | them 
people | to ask how | somebody 
That question | is | kind of irrelevant 
you | can be | the vice president 
you | can raise | a family 
I | 'm | the governor 
I | 'm raising | a family 
I | have been | a mayor 
I | have owned | a business 
we | have raised | a family 
What people | have asked | me 
I | was | governor 
you | going to be | the governor 
I | will do | it 
the other governors | have done | it 
they | have either had | a baby 
office | raised | a family 
they | 're | men 
they | do | it 
She | talks | the bridge 
We | will get | our panel's take 
Hurricane Ike | taking | aim 
They | 're starting to feel | the first licks of the shore 
We | showed | you 
her | discussion | Charlie Gibson 
the earmarks | was | Alaska's 
the lower 48 | refer | to 
it | was | a bridge 
we | killed | that earmark 
We | killed | that project 
You | supported | that bridge 
you | opposed | it 
you | turned | it 
Congress | had basically pulled | the plug 
you | want to revise and extend | your remarks 
the rest of the nation | does not want to fund | that project 
you | have | a choice 
You | read | the writing 
it | do to continue to support | something 
You | call | an audible 
you | deal | reality 
we | killed | the bridge 
that | is | the bottom line 
She | commented | family 
Obama | should have picked | Hillary Clinton 
We | 're digging | deeper tonight 
the bridge | to nowhere undermine | her 
you | think | she 
I | think | people 
I | defended | her 
I | thought | her answers 
she | is | well-brief 
Incoherent | > | GERGEN 
she | was pressed | Charlie Gibson 
a couple occasions | to name | three things 
a McCain-Palin administration | would do | that 
she | started | tax cuts 
that | is | what 
She | talked | oversight of agencies 
That | is exactly | what 
she | said | she 
they | would cut | spending 
That | would be | a change 
she | started | entitlements 
we | will find | efficiencies 
That | 's where | spending 
The spending | is | the agencies 
The agencies | are just | passers 
They | 're spending | a huge amount of the money 
that | goes | entitlements 
she | complained | the deficits 
that | have been made | the economic plans 
they | are increase | the deficits 
it | was | an incoherent answer 
It | reflected | a 
I | think | it 
Palin | brought | Hillary Clinton 
us | listen | what 
I | saw | you 
You | think | Obama 
her | > | PALIN 
I | think | he 
grit | even grace | some tough shots 
that | were fired | her way 
She | handled | those 
LAUGHTER ) | > | > HILARY ROSEN 
she | came | quite likable , and 
I | found | rather sort of snide 
McCain | got | a girl 
I | bet | Obama's regretting 
he | did n't get | a girl 
I | found | that really off-putting 
she | acknowledged | she 
it | is | just kind of abuse 
this sort of constant backtracking | is | a problem 
the earmark issue | is | what 
they | would do | the money 
What | are | you 
that | is | the part 
she | did n't have | an answer 
we | 're going to give | all the money 
we | save | tax cuts 
Barack Obama | has | a different plan 
he | saves | reform 
he | 's going to give | tax cuts 
the middle class | improve | health insurance 
we | have now gotten | her 
I | think | we 
supporters | see | it 
Palin | seemed to change | her position 
I | 'm | one 
who | would attribute | it 
it | seem | a flip-flop 
it | make | sense 
you | > | BAY BUCHANAN 
that | was | the error 
what | makes | you 
the handlers | feel | she 
which | would be | a real mistake 
her popularity | is | she 
she | feels very passionately | things 
She | does n't ( | INAUDIBLE ) 
We | know | she 
It | makes | her 
she | is | her own person 
I | would warn | handlers 
her | being | just a parrot 
that | is | what 
She | was | a little nervous yesterday 
She | hit | a good double 
I | thought | you 
she | is | just a charming person 
she | sells | herself 
Supporters | saw | it 
her | detractors see | it 
We | 're going to continue to talk | this
