it | did n't take long | the new team 
Dana Bash | was | them 
We | will talk | her next 
I | have stood | the old politics 
( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ) | > | > COOPER 
Most Americans | getting | their first look 
she | barely know | one another 
you | heard earlier | John King 
most people | know | her 
the governor | are working to change | that 
John McCain's urgent task | is exposing | his little-known running mate 
his wife | went | one way 
Sarah Palin and family | went | another 
It | is | a new political pair 
the country | to accept | them 
they | know | each other 
McCain | met | Palin just 
this | are | a big reason 
McCain | picked | her 
images of a young mother | trying to do | it 
he | hopes | female voters 
who | wonder why | the man 
experience | would pick | a small-town Alaskan mayor 
That | is | what 
what | do you say | your critics 
who | are saying | you 
enough experience | to do | the job 
I | have appreciated | the 13 years 
I | have had to give | me 
some good experience | to get | this job 
It | 's been | good experience 
she | got back | McCain's Straight Talk Express 
Ohio | did n't just bring | buzz 
It | generated | intrigue 
Time | to get back | the bus 
It | is | a bold choice 
that | has | many 
Washington | shaking | their heads 
they | know | each other 
McCain | to reach out | someone 
he | does n't have | a 
it | seemed | character 
I | have been observing | him 
you | hear | me 
I | hear | you 
we | get | a sense 
he | is | somebody 
who | likes to have | people 
That | is why | I 
that | was | one of his key criterion 
they | insist | it 
she | operates | the state of Alaska 
that | attracted | him 
he | sees | her what 
he | has | a level 
He | might not know | her 
it | is | an important connection 
that | was | a main reason 
he | decided to go | her 
she | is | a supporter of gun rights 
she | is | an opponent of abortion 
she | is | a she 
she | is | a woman 
that | is | a package 
that | really helps | him 
Dana Bash | reporting | New Concord 
She | 's | these parts 
she | 's | Washington 
you | 're going to be as impressed | I 
She | 's got | the grit 
that | is exactly | what 
we | need | Washington 
( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ) | > | > COOPER 
John McCain | talking | the woman 
he | would like to be | America's first female vice president 
us | talk | strategy 
who | is | me 
an independent conservative | is | Amy 
a lot of Americans | have not heard | her 
voters | do you think | McCain 
I | agree | David 
this | is | a gamble 
we | do n't know how | she 
That | can be | a very unforgiving place 
she | does bring | the table 
This | is | a woman 
who | is | a hunter 
She | does n't just vote | the NRA. 
it | cooks | it 
you | see | her 
you | have | all of these amazing , colorful things 
I | think | John McCain 
This | is also | a mother of five 
She | had to make | a very difficult decision 
who | has | syndrome 
she | 's | word 
she | is | deed 
She | walked | the walk 
I | think | that 
women | are | a monolith 
John McCain | has | a chance 
you | have been | this show many times 
the choice of Sarah Palin | affect | that 
I | think | it 
I | think | there 
that | 's been missing | this campaign 
John McCain | has been | excitement and enthusiasm 
there | is | great enthusiasm 
he | has | the record 
he | does n't talk | a lot 
he | -- | what 
this selection | was | a very positive move 
that | speaks | volumes 
She | endorsed | Pat Buchanan 
he | is | a hero 
that | is | sort of number one 
she | 's going to have | some appeal 
her appeal | is | that 
there | was | some question 
Hillary | got | 18 million voters 
I | said | earlier 
There | are | not many 
there | are | many Hillary Buchanan 
I | promise | you 
( LAUGHTER ) | > | > CARVILLE 
It | is | kind 
I | think | she 
she | had | a lot of appeal 
I | 'm | a little mystified 
he | had met | her 
he | picked | her 
this whole thing | was | a little bit 
John King | reported | they 
they | had | two 
( CROSSTALK) ( LAUGHTER ) | > | > CARVILLE 
it | is | two meetings 
( CROSSTALK) ( LAUGHTER ) | > | > CARVILLE 
( LAUGHTER ) | > | > COOPER 
can Republicans | argue | this 
a choice | made | governance 
this a choice | made purely | politics 
I | think | she 
she | is | the only one 
that | has | executive experience 
She | has been | governor 
She | 's been | a mayor 
I | was | Alaska 
her name | was being tossed | a little bit 
she | 's held | high regard 
She | is | someone 
She | has | a good record 
she | does bring | the political element 
She | solidifies | the base 
He | has | the experience 
She | has | the 
that | has been missing | this campaign 
I | think | it 
They | can cast | a historic vote 
a conservative ticket | voting | her 
the first woman | to be elected | vice president of the United States 
I | think | it 
I | will ask | you 
her | being | a heartbeat 
I | do n't have | a concern 
the experience issue | was not ever something | that 
It | is actually | more ideology 
that | is | my concern 
you | know | what 
There | is | nothing 
it | being | a little bit of both 
Sarah Palin | has | a 
This | is | someone 
who | has gone | her own party 
this | is | a woman 
who | said | Ted Stevens 
she | brings | that 
it | helps | John McCain 
This | is | a man 
who | has been | the Senate all these years 
he | can campaign | an outsider 
who | has never voted | an earmark 
she | helps | him 
We | value | all perspectives
