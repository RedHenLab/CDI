New attacks | were launched | today 
We | will get | all of that 
here | is | what 
both candidates | said | the economy 
I | have got | news 
They | 're losing | their jobs 
They | 're losing | their health care 
They | 're losing | their homes 
They | 're losing | their savings 
I | cannot imagine | anything 
Working families | are worried | the price of grocery 
their jobs | paying | their mortgage 
We | need to restore | confidence 
A new Research poll | shows | the majority of Americans 
they | believe | another economic depression 
That | is | depression 
D. One financial analyst | said | today 
us | start | with CNN senior business correspondent Ali Velshi 
President Bush | signed | this bailout 
The markets | did | what 
they | did | today 
This | was not supposed to be | the reaction 
It | started | the day 
what | happened | 2:00 
It | was down | 800 points 
you | have made | your first investment 
you | saw | it 
the credit bailout | was supposed to fix | the credit freeze 
fact | operates very differently | the stock market 
The stock market | makes | money 
the stock market | make | money 
those companies | make | money 
regular people | spend | money 
regular people | spend | money 
They | have to feel | they 
That | means | they 
That | means | their wages 
We | saw | Friday 
I | talked | this 
three-quarter-of-a-million jobs | lost | this year 
We | should have | 1.5 million 
all | know | home prices 
you | put | all of this together 
you | end | this mess 
stock markets | going | because companies 
84 percent of people | said | the economic conditions 
We | 're | October 
We | 're almost entering | the final quarter of the year 
Americans | spend | their money 
It | 's called | Black Friday 
that | is | the day 
America | went | the black 
you | 're feeling | this economic pinch 
you | are just not going to spend | that kind 
Companies | are counting | the fact 
Americans | are holding | very tight 
they | loosen | it 
you | 're not going to see | profitability 
I | want to show | our folks something 
CNBC | said | today 
It | freaked | a lot of people 
us | play | this 
you | may need | the next five years 
I | do not believe | you 
it | is | kind of the advice 
we | heard | Suze Orman 
people | watch | him 
they | trade | stocks 
what Cramer | is saying | is 
you | need | that money 
you | need | the short term 
You | do n't really hear | it 
he | 's | the market 
who | want | general investment advice 
Cramer caters | to stock | buyers 
he | 's sending | a message 
who | watch | him 
you | 're going to need | this money 
It | is | very sound advice 
we | have been hearing | huge subprime mortgage losses 
That | is | a big part of what 
Congress | passed | Friday 
the jam | has barely budged | the Dow 
it | is | all-time high 
us | bring | Andy Serwer 
there | are | a lot of people 
there | is | no indication 
that | is | one reason 
the stock market | went | down 
there | is | fear 
there | are | more troubling signs 
we | have n't seen | the worst of that 
Jim Cramer | is talking | selling stocks 
it | 's | a pretty picture 
Should people | hold | on spending 
things | go | the near future 
people | are n't spending | money 
there | is | no consumer confidence 
that | adds | the problem 
all | feeds | itself 
you | have | a good job 
you | feel | things 
your kids | need | stuff 
It | is never | a good time 
it | is never | a good time 
you | need | stuff 
I | guess | the scary thing 
we | do n't probably really know where | we 
the bailout | was | step one 
There | are | a lot more steps 
we | have got | the bailout 
That | is step | one 
it | is | a good thing 
There | are | actually steps 
terms | buying | these assets 
we | have n't bottomed out | all 
we | need to restore | confidence 
We | need to make | things 
I | think | what 
the economy | is | a patient 
we | have got to stop fighting | things 
which | doctor | we 
we | have | a private room 
I | think | we 
us | play | some of that 
our economy | is | a state of crisis 
you | get to keep | $ 480 million 
I | have | a very basic question 
your firm | faced | a liquidity crisis 
I | remind | you 
you | 're | oath 
we | did not mislead | our investors 
there | is | no doubt 
this | is | political grandstanding 
A lot of these same | are | the ones 
who | were watching | this stuff 
Capitol Hill | allowed | this 
these people | to run | rampant and allowed legislation 
It | is | a legitimate issue 
I | agree | you 
I | 'm | we 
I | think | it 
there | is | any criminal behavior 
I | do n't know | what 
we | get | these sort of show trials 
they | make | good television 
It | is | sort of tertiary 
I | think | it

we | are going to be looking | exactly who 
a lot of people | had | their hands 
us | know | what
