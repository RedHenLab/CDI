the nation's financial system | coming together | Capitol Hill 
it | may take | trillions of dollars 
That | is | trillions 
The meeting | broke | a short time 
a plan | roughed | the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve 
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson | had | this 
we | are working | now is 
an approach | to deal | the systemic risk 
we | have talked | a 
that | will require | legislation 
we | have said | some time 
the capital markets | is | the real estate correction 
what | 's going | terms of the price declines 
which | is aimed right | the heart of this problem 
which | is | illiquid assets 
we | 're going to be looking | what 
all of that | means | you 
Suze Orman | joins | us 
We | will also be showing | you 
you | can learn | which of your assets 
CNN's Ali Velshi | is monitoring | all the latest developments 
what | do you make | this 
you | look | the assembly 
it | was | Paulson 
it | was | Ben Bernanke 
it | was | Chris Cox 
They | 're saying | they 
We | have heard | the these 
They | are talking | a fast deal 
you | said | trillions 
It | might be fashioned | what 
the government | formed | an agency 
that | bought | all the bad properties 
It | is | somebody 
they | did n't have to sell | it 
it | was | just junk 
we | are talking | possibly trillions of dollars 
the government | buying | up bad debt 
the market | letting | the market 
it | is | just a sign 
> | > | OWNING 
they | 're getting together | the week 
you | saw | Mr. Paulson 
You | heard | him 
kind | knew | what 
you | were putting | there 
It | was | properties 
It | was | properties 
what | is | it 
they | 're going to put | this 
what | is | it 
the government | have | a grip 
the full extent of this | > | VELSHI 
That | is why | we 
nobody | knows | this 
what | is | they 
the plan | has worked | the past 
this type of bailout | has actually been | the end 
we | do n't know | what 
it | is | they 
We | should point | The Wall Street Journal 
the SEC | wants to temporarily ban | shorting stocks 
What | does | that mean 
London | has banned shorting | stocks 
It | means | people 
Shorting | means betting | the horse 
they | 're treating | it 
some people | have been deliberately betting | companies 
that | has happened | the last several years 
that | do | some shorting 
you | are | a tough market 
some of these mutual funds | are | sort of help 
terms | limiting | your downside loss 
this | is | a market mechanism 
It | is | a very unusual move 
that | regulates | trading 
everybody | has been either talking | brokers 
they | have | them 
What | is | the advice 
folks | sitting | home 
Suze | > | ORMAN 
the advice | is | I 
you | have | time 
you | 're investing | a 401(k ) 
you | have to keep | investing 
This | is | the time 
you | need | money 
You | need | money 
it | happens to be | the stock market 
money | to send | your kids 
you | say | the time frame 
I | have always had | a rule 
you | need | five years 
less | does n't belong | the stock market 
something | goes | 50 percent 
you | need | it 
12 years | to get back | where 
Suze | made | an interesting point 
we | got | air 
you | have | 15 or 20 years 
you | are feeling | you 
what | 's going on | this market 
what | do you tell | them 
what | is going to happen | is 
the market | wept up | 400- some-odd points today 
This | is going to go | morning 
each day | has | a different effect 
I | saw | 400 points 
I | 'm | I 
it | does n't make | any sense 
you | 're | the stock 
you | 're | you 
the stock market | is when | the economy 
everybody | is making | money 
We | have | unemployment 
We | have | real estate 
it | 's getting | a little better 
We | have | major problems 
they | do | this 
it | does n't help | terms of who 
the money | to buy | a new house 
they | have lent | you 
what | are | they 
you | 're looking | safe investments 
you | have | it 
you | have | it 
you | have | FDIC insurance 
I | 'm just quickly going to say | this 
I | have partnered | the FDIC. 
You | will see | my little face 
you | will find | your money 
We | have | that link 
there | are | three ways 
one | is | you 
you | 're increasing | your wealth 
three | is | the value of your home 
we | started to gain | jobs 
people | would feel | a little wealthier 
they | would spend | money 
people | feeling | wealthy and spending 
all | want to believe | there 
you | talk | the person 
who | is managing | your account 
you | want to believe | they 
no experts alive | have really seen | this kind of a thing 
there | was | '87 
there | was | the Internet bust 
you | talk | people 
me | ask | you 
You | have | a financial adviser 
your expert | say | you 
I | want | you 
It | is | nobody 
Nobody | has ever seen | this 
Nobody | has | an understanding of what's happening 
what | does | a normal human being 
You | do | what 
it | takes to make | yourself 
I | 'm going to catch | a good buy 
Suze | is going to be | Erica Hill's live Webcast 
that | got | us 
We | will talk | that
