the situation | becoming | more precarious 
I | faced | the choice 
the irresponsibility actions of some | to undermine | the financial security of all 
President Bush | delivering | his most important address 
He | outlined | a very bleak economic future 
Congress | did back | the plan 
His message | was | lawmakers

he | 's been preaching | a very 
We | decided to take | a look 
Ours | is | a belief 
we | should n't bail | lenders 
we | should n't be using | taxpayers 
you | made | a lousy loan 
we | 're going to subsidize | you 
this economy | rests | the hands of the American people 
Our financial institutions | are | our capital markets 
We | can have | confidence 
You | heard | the president 
taxpayers | should n't bailout | lenders 
we | learn | he 
the White House tomorrow | to discuss | the bailout bill 
It | is | all happening 
the campaign | turning | upside-down today 
Obama spokesman Bill Burton | released | this statement 
Senator Obama | believed | the administration's initial proposal 
he | was heartened tonight | the president 
Senator Obama | outlined | the last week 
Lots | to talk | our " Strategy Session 
we | 're suspending | the campaign 
This | is | an altruistic move 
This | is | politics 
you | buy | that 
We | 're | 39 days 
I | thought | it 
it | worked | briefly 
I | did n't think | the Palin thing 
I | think now | it 
This | is | another tactic 
he | undermines | his central message 
which | is | I 
I | 'll be | a strong , capable .. 
you | saying | he 
he | 's dipping | the polls 
he | needs to try | kind 
the mantleship | being | a leader 
he | 's dipping | the polls 
it | is | we 
We | had | a presidential campaign 
Sherman | was marching | Atlanta 
We | had | a presidential election 
D-Day | was going | in Normandy 
We | can have | a debate 
it | is probably | the most important thing 
it | depends | what 
what Obama | does | his next 40 days 
everybody | is going to say | it 
Obama | are | senators 
They | should be doing | their job 
their leadership | could really make | a difference 
McCain | is accustomed | that 
He | is | the middle of the fray 
He | understands | the influence 
he | can use to persuade | things 
Obama | is very used to... > | > COOPER 
both of these guys | do n't seem to mind missing | a huge amount of votes 
it | 's | these guys 
They | have voted | the last year 
You | 've got | that right 
this | is | just not any old bill 
This bill | is going to affect | Americans 
it | 's going to tie | the hands of the next president 
you | want to be | president 
I | think | there 
I | do n't think | they 
four days | to prepare | a debate 
this thing | is right down | the wire 
they | 're pushing | a resolution 
I | think | both of them 
Washington | to represent | the millions of Americans 
their philosophy | to make | we 
it | pushed as best | it 
I | want to read | something Newt Gingrich 
He | put | everything 
the line | to try to put | a bipartisan sizable economic package 
This | is | the greatest single act of responsibility 
Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer | said | today 
us | play | that 
We | do not need | an injection of presidential politics 
you | 're | the middle 
me | throw | my brush marks 
it | does n't make | sense 
John McCain | is going to swoop | town 
I | think | they 
I | think | they 
I | talk to think | it 
? | > | BEGALA 
he | said | the fundamentals of the economy 
there | is | such a crisis 
he | ca n't even run | a TV commercial 
this | were | two governors 
These fellows | are | the senators 
It | is | their responsibility 
It | is | what 
we | pay | them 
it | is | time 
they | took | some accountability 
they | sign | on 
That | is why | they 
I | think | McCain 
He | understands | he 
Obama | has spent | his lifetime 
I | hear | you 
I | hear | you 
governors | can say | something 
this | is resolved | the Congress of the United States
