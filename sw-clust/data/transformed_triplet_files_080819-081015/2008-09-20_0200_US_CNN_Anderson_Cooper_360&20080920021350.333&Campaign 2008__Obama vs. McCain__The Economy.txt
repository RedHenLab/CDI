Wall Street | started | the Washington culture of lobbying and influence peddling 
he | was | right square 
I | can continue to argue | our different economic agendas 
Senator Obama | spending much | the day counterpunching 
both candidates | support | a financial bailout 
even advisers admit | were | a series of stumbles 
John McCain | played | offense 
Government | has | a clear responsibility 
That | is exactly | what 
McCain | called | a new government trust 
financial institutions | reach | crisis 
An early intervention program | to help | financial institutions 
McCain | is urgently trying to convince | voters 
he | has got | a specific plan 
advisers | say | his campaign strategy 
as much | discrediting | Barack Obama's credentials 
the economy | presenting | his own 
he | could spare | us 
the lectures | admit | his own poor judgment 
That | is | a direct attack 
Obama | taking | more than $ 100,000 
Freddie Mac | taking | advice 
Fannie Mae | was betraying | the public trust 
its former CEO | had managed to gain | my opponent's trust 
Senator Obama | put | him 
the entire campaign | saying | I 
I | think | it 
Senator McCain | is | a little panicked 
( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ) | > | > BASH 
the part of chief executive | dealing | crisis 
we | 're looking | right 
markets | to maintain | credit 
Obama | made | he 
Washington | to rescue sinking | financial markets 
he | 's said | he 
on | offering | his own plan 
Obama | calls | it 
You | do n't do | it 
We | have got to do | it 
there | is | no doubt 
The competition | is to prove | they 
she | is | the central role 
she | plays | her not-so 
that | speaks | the Sarah Palin effect 
What | is | effect 
's it | wearing | three weeks
