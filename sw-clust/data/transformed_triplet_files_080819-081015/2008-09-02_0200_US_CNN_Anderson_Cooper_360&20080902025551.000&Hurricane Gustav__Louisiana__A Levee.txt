that | has caused | a lot of concern 
We | 're just now hearing | the situation 
The parish president | tells | us 
We | have stopped | the bleeding 
We | have stopped | the bleeding 
who | stayed | the area 
the parish president | put | the call 
insurance claims | are expected to hit | $ 10 billion 
Tom Foreman | shows | us 
today | to give | you 
we | can start | Biloxi 
This | is | one of the points 
the storm | went right | this coastal road 
We | had | water 
you | move | New Orleans 
all eyes | were | Lake Pontchartrain 
It | 's called | the Industrial Canal 
Water | is being pushed | both directions 
You | saw | pictures of it 
you | flew | the river 
you | would come | the Braithwaite area 
That | is | the one 
that | came up late | this afternoon 
the neighborhoods | down | it 
it | coming | these little private levees and canals 
That | is | what 
they | were | later on 
we | have to look | is 
you | look | places 
you | went | Houma and Lafayette 
you | saw | the same thing 
they | were | the eye 
they | had | that tremendous wind power 
they | add up | the rain 
the final tally | will be | Gustav 
Mayor Ray Nagin | called | it 
he | ordered | the evacuation of the city 
People | responded | that 
Gustav | has been | less damaging than 
Mayor Nagin | is breathing | a little easier tonight 
he | thinks | it 
Mayor Nagin | joins | me 
I | think | we 
who | watched | television 
the federal government | was | it 
What | are | the biggest lessons 
you | could do | this time 
we | had | everything 
We | had | a good plan 
We | had practiced | it 
you | saw | something 
I | have | is 
there | 's supposed to be | another storm surge 
which | is | one of our weak points 
it | is just | a matter 
the city | to receive | our citizens 
we | 're going to start | those assessments and repairs first thing 
who | are staying | hotels or shelters 
they | ca n't wake | tomorrow morning 
I | would n't advise | that 
we | have | downed power lines 
We | have | trees 
The hospitals | have | skeletal crews 
We | have | a lot of work 
I | would anticipate | Wednesday 
we | can start to receive | some of our key businesses 
you | worried | people 
the pictures of levees | holding | the response of this storm 
which | was | a lot 
you | know | what 
New Orleans | does n't need | any more help 
New Orleans | seems pretty much | its own 
They | do n't need | much more federal money 
it | was | a success 
it | 's going to be | New Orleans 
you | need | them 
we | can evacuate effectively | we 
that | was downgraded | a Category 2 
it | hit | landfall 
We | have not gotten | the big one 
we | have | a 100-year storm 
we | have | a lot of work 
I | think | people 
you | got really criticized | the last time 
You | should also get praised when | you 
I | 'm | a lot of folks 
you | telling | you 
you | did | just that 
they | saw | you 
we | appreciate | you 
we | appreciate | you
