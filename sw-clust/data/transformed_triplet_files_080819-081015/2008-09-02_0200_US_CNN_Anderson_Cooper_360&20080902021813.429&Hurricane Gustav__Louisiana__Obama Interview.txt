You | were | there three years

the federal , and local municipalities | have coordinated | them 
We | have seen | the evacuation of two million people 
I | got | the phone 
He | indicates | they 
the process | doing | aerial surveys 
They | are | the process 
who | may not have observed | the evacuation order 
we | have been doing | what 
we | 're not hearing | reports of loss 
you | believe | the Bush administration 
fact | acknowledged and learned | the mistakes of Katrina 
the key | is | they 
which | is | something 
they | did not do | last time 
you | started seeing | buses 
I | was | the fact 
we | made | Congress 
I | passed | a bipartisan bill 
that | was activated | Gustav 
we | had put | place assurances 
we | would have | plans 
That | was put | place 
it | is | a little bit 
terms | dealing | flood damage 
there | is | any 
small businesses and homeowners | are getting | the relief 
I | think | we 
we | doing | things 
We | ca n't be going | these kinds of crises

There | is | nothing 
There | was | a report today 
it | was | yesterday 
The New York Times | indicating | the Road Home program 
that | had not ended up being utilized just | because red tape and bureaucracy 
we | have n't seen are | the kinds of efficient programs 
that | get | the people 
a government | ca n't do | everything 
communities | recover | a flood 
it | is | Iowa 
it | is | New Orleans 
that | is going to be | one of my highest priorities 
we | respond immediately | a storm 
we | 're putting in | the levee systems

we | are helping | people 
these communities | can get back | their feet 
John McCain | was here | Sunday

I | will be | a hot second 
it | turns | what local officials 
we | do | our work 
our Web site | activating | volunteers and donors 
that | is | what 
some of your Republican critics have | said | you 
the experience | to handle | a situation 
fact | have said | Governor Palin 
We | have got | 2,500 
I | think | their budget

we | can provide | the kinds of support 
Great | to talk | you
