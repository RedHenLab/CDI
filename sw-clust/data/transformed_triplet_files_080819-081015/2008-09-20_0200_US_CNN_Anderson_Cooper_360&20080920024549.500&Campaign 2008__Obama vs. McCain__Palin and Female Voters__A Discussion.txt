I | 've | kind of 
the policies | affect | women and families 
this | is just | politics 
she | participated | an economic roundtable 
just 46 days | to go | the election 
women voters | are being targeted | never before 
Sarah Palin | paying | the GOP 
The female vote | has never been | play 
it | seems | every pundit and pollster 
everybody | knows | women 
both national campaigns | are focused | the women's vote 
nearly 20 percent of female voters | say | they 
their minds | come | election day 
just six weeks | left | this neck and neck race 
I | think | the bread-and-butter issues 
that | have to do | I 
those | are | the issues 
candidates | have to connect | them 
Sarah Palin | has provided | a much-needed boost of energy 
Republicans | are | momentum 
Women | are not naturally voting | Republican 
we | seem to have captured | enormous numbers of them 
he | has sent | a message 
I | do understand | your values 
I | share | them 
he | brought | Sarah Palin 
That | may be | more wishful thinking 
CNN polls | show | the number of women 
McCain | is | Palin 
unfavorable rating | is | the rise 
Palin's gender | had | no effect 
They | endorsed | Obama 
We | endorsed | Obama 
It | is | economic rights 
It | is | reproductive choice 
Mandel | warns | it 
the Democratic Party | have taken | them 
who | felt offended | the way 
a sense | to identify | a woman 
I | 'm not going to take | that 
that woman | to make | the difference 
With more now on the latest polling and women voters, as well as the issues that have galvanized them, joining us again, GOP strategist and CNN political contributor Ed Rollins; Democratic strategist and CNN political contributor Hillary Rosen; and senior political correspondent Candy Crowley. 
that | have | them 
which | shows | Sarah Palin 
what | has | she 
She | 's energized | our base 
an opportunity | to get | independent women 
I | thought | there 
us | to go get | Hillary Clinton's Democrats 
they | 're | Democrats 
Democrats | do | Republicans 
I | think | she 
Lady de Rothschild | > | ROLLINS 
Hillary | may get | her 
I | think | the reality 
she | has made | us 
women | are | a singular group 
They | 're | the largest group of voters 
I | think | she 
I | do n't think | a 72-year-old man 
I | think | she 
we | 've heard | time and time 
voters | are | the ones 
Obama | has | the most trouble 
the campaign | figured | a way 
it | starts | Hillary Clinton 
You | 've certainly seen | a number of women 
Obama | did | a woman's forum today 
all the things | considered to be | women's issues 
they | 're | all kind of co-mingling 
I | think | women 
we | 're | of the same place 
there | was | a big push 
women | vote | more 
men | vote | more 
I | think | it 
an attempt | to bring | women 
I | think | she 
an attempt | to bring | the conservative base 
she | proved to be | men 
We | learned | today 
Hillary Clinton | is going to be launching | a new effort 
they | used | Hillary Clinton well 
the last couple of weeks | has n't had | as much visibility 
women | is how | it 
Obama | has | a 
they | 're | half and half 
Obama | has | the overwhelming majority of the college-educated women 
McCain | has | about half of the others 
Those | are | the women 
Hillary Clinton | appealed | to 
who | need | something 
their government | are still not sold | either Obama or McCain 
I | think | Hillary Clinton 
the ability | to make | a difference 
I | think | that 
you | 're going to see | her 
you | concerned how | Sarah Palin 
she | took | a shooting star 
She | was | an extraordinary star 
this game | is | a great plus 
I | would expect | her 
I | would expect | her 
She | 'll be | a star 
she | has | her debate 
this | is | her 
we | 're not going to win | this thing 
I | think | the end of the day 
You | 're | she 
I | 'm | she 
I | 've seen convinces | me 
she | will do very well | the debate 
We | 'll have to leave | it 
it | is | quite a night 
It | airs | the commercial breaks 
You | find | it 
the Web | cast | link 
you | wo n't see | Erica Hill 
you | 're already watching | the Web cast 
you | 'll know | it 
floor director Kevin | doing | the honors 
We | 're doing | our first edition of Floor Crew Friday 
we | like to call | him 
He | runs | one of our ped cameras

This | is | Bob Debus 
He | does | a lot of our set changes and scenic

Happy | belated | birthday
