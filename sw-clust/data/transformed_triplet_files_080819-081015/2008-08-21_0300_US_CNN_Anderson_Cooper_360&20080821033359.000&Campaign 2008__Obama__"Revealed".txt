you | vote | November 
we | 're trying to help | you 
That critical focus | was | the back 
back documentaries | aired earlier tonight | CNN. 
We | called | them 
We | want to show | you 
he | took | his father 
Barack Obama | was accepted | Harvard 
he | planned to study | Law 
he | knew | he 
he | travel | Kenya 
he | meet | his family 
he | began to understand | his father 
he | traveled | Kogelo 
his father's family | learn | who 
Every man | is trying to live | his father's expectations 
you | had | this person 
who | was | almost a myth 
he | was how well | he 
that | was | something 
who | had not treated | his family 
that | was | something 
you | felt | you 
The myth of his father | was soon replaced | the reality of a complicated and broken man 
He | had | trouble 
he | got back | Kenya 
ended | up dying | a tragic and bitter man 
Barack Obama's feelings of abandonment and frustration | gave | way 
It | was | I 
Kenya | heard | relatives of who 
he | had been | the story 
some ways | understand | myself 
Suzanne Malveaux | joins | us 
I | bet | you 
That | is | a lot of work 
It | took | a long time 
It | is | a lot of work 
a lot of Americans | wo n't understand | him 
he | 's | the "other 
we | 've seen | it 
it | is | the McCain's campaign 
who | is | everyone 
Michelle and Barack Obama | say only | this country 
he | talks | his mother 
they | lived | Indonesia 
he | was | a child 
he | does get | a lot of the qualities 
who | are | himself 
it | is | Hawaii 
it | is | just kind 
That | is | something 
they | need to continually focus | he 
he | takes | something 
She | was | the time 
She | did n't seem to have | any problems 
A lot of that | was passed | him 
you | have | another chapter 
it | is | he 
he | can play | hardball 
He | likes to say | he 
he | is | he 
he | knocked | a very popular African-American politician 
the ballot | challenging | her signatures 
That | is | an inside game of hardball 
they | think | he 
we | 've seen | examples 
you | 'd mentioned | Alice Palmer 
it | was | smart politics 
It | was | Palmer's own supporters 
that | is | the same kind of thing 
we | 've been reading | the tea leaves 
who | can perhaps be | that attack dog person 
who | can play | that role 
he | wants to step | a little bit 
Might | be talking | a bit 
thanks | joining | us 
we | continue | our in-depth look 
it | took to finally break | him 
he | feels | about
