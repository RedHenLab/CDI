senator Obama | says | he 
he | opposes | the surge 
No rational observer | could go | Iraq 
the last two years | say | the surge 
That | was | John McCain 
once | again hitting | Barack Obama 
McCain | has been playing | his military credentials 
Vietnam | is | a crucial part of his biography 
that | aired earlier tonight | CNN 
John McCain | had bent just | every rule 
I | hit | the water 
I | 've seen | pictures 
A large group of them | towing | me 
there | was | an even larger group 
I | was | kind of dazed 
what | had happened | me 
they | inflicted | pain 
I | was | what 
his father Admiral Jack McCain | was named | Commander of U.S. Forces Pacific 
Admiral McCain | took | the new command 
the Vietnamese | offered | John McCain freedom 
it | was | a propaganda ploy 
He | said | no 
The POW's code of conduct | called | release 
There | were | dozens 
men | taken | prisoner 
that | earned | John McCain more 
it | was | the North Vietnamese 
I | would not do | that 
McCain | recalled being beaten | as many as ten guards 
the deeds of an air pirate | expressing | gratitude 
you | let | yourself 
I | set | myself 
you | were writing | those words 
what | were | you 
I | was obviously | very desperate physical shape 
who | served | communications director 
you | know | the biography 
you | take | something 
he | went | Vietnam 
it | was | 40 years 
you | take | that and 
> | > | DAN SCHNUR 
I | think | you 
very few voters | are going to support | John McCain 
he | was | a prisoner of war 30-some , 
he | has done successfully | the past 
he | 's found | a way 
you | look | John Kerry 
both | talked | their experiences 
a way | to make | that relevant 
he | talks | he 
he | talks | national security and foreign policy issues 
he | finds | a way 
that experience | make | it 
that | fascinated | me 
this | is | you 
John McCain | will be | 72 
He | is | a child of World War II 
you | put | a jacket 
dinner | called | your father sir 
a worry | is | the McCain campaign 
I | think | it 
the campaign | becomes | his wartime experience 
he | does | is 
he | 's not going to get | a lot of votes 
it | is | a matter 
he | experienced | Vietnam 
he | experienced just | the military 
his political career | is | something 
2008 | ought to pay | attention to 
I | 'll give | you 
you | look | this morning's " Los Angeles Times " poll 
which | showed | the race 
it | asked | voters 
they | preferred | Senator Obama's approach 
the same voters | said | they 
John McCain more | to handle | the situation 
that past experience | show | voters 
it | should matter | them 
that | are | them 
It | is | a fascinating race 
Dan Schnur thanks | sharing | your thoughts 
We | 'll catch | you 
Thanks | having | me
