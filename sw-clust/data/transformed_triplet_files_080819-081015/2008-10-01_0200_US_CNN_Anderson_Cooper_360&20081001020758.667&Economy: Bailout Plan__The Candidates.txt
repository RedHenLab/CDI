We | have got | a severe crisis of confidence 
this | is | a system 
that | does n't take | care of the fat cats 
There | is | plenty of blame 
Wall Street | deserve | it 
All of us | have | a responsibility 
it | affects | the financial well-being of every single American 
today | trying to sound | problem 
they | will be | the Senate floor 
they | say | they 
they | were pointing | fingers 
Ed Henry | has | the " Raw Politics 
> > | ED | HENRY 
John McCain | admit | he 
McCain | chose | a shift 
I | think | I 
America | hear | what 
we | 're going to have to get | the support of all Americans 
Obama | sunk | the deal 
McCain | did n't even mention | his rival 
Congress | came | empty-handed 
it | was | McCain 
who | came | empty-handed 
democrats | are | his new tact 
I | think | it 
the beginning | to think | that 
you | can actually have | a positive impact 
Barack Obama | is recalibrating | his rhetoric 
the crisis | to also go to bat | the bailout 
There | will be | time 
who | set | this fire 
Capitol Hill | turns | the small part of the electorate 
you | call | names 
it | does n't do | you 
any good | going | those independent voters 
the rescue plan | is | both nominees 
Voters | are overwhelming | the capital switchboard and e-mail servers 
little choice | to push | a solution 
he | have to look | he 
he | has to fix | the problem 
that | 's | McCain 
lawmakers | are getting are | the bailout 
high-profile way | > | HENRY 
He | 's running | his campaign 
it | would be | him 
the politics | are | this a 
We | 're getting | a lot of calls 
He | has got to stand | this 
He | 's rolling | the dice 
you | heard | that Republican strategist 
the economy | is | a big problem 
He | 's got to take | that chance 
he | tries to portray | himself 
it | does n't necessarily hurt | him 
him | standing up | some of his fellow Republicans 
this bailout | is | a bad idea 
we | have got to give | it 
It | 's | a perfect bill 
we | 're | a crisis right 
There | is | a new picture of her there 
they | 're calling | debate camp 
We | will also show | you
