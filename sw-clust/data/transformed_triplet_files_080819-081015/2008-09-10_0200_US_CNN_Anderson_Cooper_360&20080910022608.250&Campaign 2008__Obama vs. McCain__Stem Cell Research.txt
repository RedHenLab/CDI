The explosive issue of stem cell research | took | center stage 
It | is | a subject 
that | continues to divide | America 
the McCain camp | accused | Senator Biden 
a new low | using | the stem cell debate 
Down syndrome | may be | the woman 
who | wants to be | vice president 
That | is why | it 
we | heard | this 
who | wants to be | vice president 
I | hear | all this talk 
who | have | both 
there | is | joy 
the difficulty | raising | a child 
who | has | a developmental disability 
who | are born | a birth defect 
you | care | it 
you | support | stem cell research 
you | 're going to do | this stuff 
( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ) | > | > TUCHMAN 
Barack Obama support | embryonic | stem cell research 
Should Alaska | allows | stem cell research 
Sarah Palin | was asked | the topic 
she | ran | governor of Alaska 
that | would ultimately end | destruction of life 
It | 's | Palin 
Biden's comments | directed | Palin 
who | has said | she 
A Biden spokesman | said | no . Palin's opposition 
embryonic stem cell research | is | President Bush's 
He | made | this statement 
This | is | a tough issue 
I | would remind | you 
We | need to do | what 
we | can to relieve | human suffering 
It | is | a tough issue 
I | support | federal funding 
We | do n't know | John McCain 
Sarah Palin | have discussed | their differences 
We | do know | the McCain campaign 
A McCain spokesman | issued | this statement 
Barack Obama's running mate | sunk | a new low today 
who | cares more | special needs children 
this issue | is | a desperate campaign 
this | is | a clash of personalities 
You | could accuse | us 
our hearts | are | sync 
the two vice presidential candidates | have | their heads
