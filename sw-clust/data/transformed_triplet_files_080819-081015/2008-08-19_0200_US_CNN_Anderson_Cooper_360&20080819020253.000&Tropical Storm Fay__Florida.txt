Fay | could do up | a billion dollars 
us | turn now | CNN's Chad Myers 
He | is | the Weather Center 
I | know | you 
earlier this | is | a tough storm 
What | do we know | this hour 
this | was going to be | a Category 3 hurricane 
it | is barely | a hurricane 
it | 's going to hit | the west coast of Florida 
it | hit | Puerto Rico 
it | hit | the Dominican Republic 
of | took | the stuffing 
this storm | would n't have hit | those islands 
this | could easily be | a major hurricane 
it | 's going to produce | tornadoes 
We | got | a brand-new tornado warning 
this | is | south central Broward County 
that | is | Miramar and Pembroke Pines 
The storm | is moving | the northwest 
this | is going to be | the story 
you | see | that red box 
That | is | a tornado watch box 
That | will go | all night 
they | are coming onshore | little waterspouts 
they | could contain | tornadoes 
There | is | the spin of the storm 
That | is where | our Gary Tuchman 
what | is developing to be | an eye 
we | 're finally getting | it 
eye wall | getting | into east Naples and Marco 
The storm | will then turn | the right 
It | will go | the entire state of Florida 
This | is | just one model 
It | could go | the left 
It | could go | Tampa 
It | could go | the right 
It | could brush | north Miami-Dade 
We | do think | it 
We | 're going to keep following | the storm 
you | do see | an awful lot of people 
it | happened | the beach 
We | do n't know | who 
We | do know | he 
He | is | the hospital , condition unknown 
You | can see | that video 
he | is | the hospital 
He | did survive | pretty tough crash 
We | 're going to have | more breaking news
