These attacks | do n't hurt | Barack Obama 
these attacks | do n't hurt | me 
an attempt | to get | you 
what | 's going | your family 
what | is | your neighborhood 
I | mean | this literally 
what | is | John McCain 
There | 's been | a lot of discussion 
There | is also | a number of edited videos 
We | decided to see | ourselves 
We | 'll do | the same thing 
what Gary Tuchman | found | the trail 
the NASCAR vote | is | an important priority 
this | was | an ideal place 
The left-wing liberal media | have always been | a really close-knit family 
Hank Williams Jr. | customized | his song 
The original song | includes | the lyric 
it | is | a family tradition 
Few | seemed to care or to know | the original words 
they | partied politically | Palin 
I | would love to hear | Barack Obama 
he | wants America to win | > TUCHMAN 
No mention of a recent claim Barack Obama | pals around | terrorists 
you | heard | Sarah Palin talks 
him | palling | terrorists 
I | have | a real problem 
I | tell | my children 
I | do n't want | my president 
what | does | that mean 
you | saying | he 
he | 'd be | terrorists 
What | do | you 
I | think | he 
I | think | it 
You | 're known | the company 
she | did n't mention | the investigation 
that | led | the conclusion 
she | abused | her gubernatorial powers 
her political antenna | may be | a bit 
her enthusiastic supporters | started shouting | the word "louder 
they | could hear | her 
she | thought | they 
I | would hope | at least 
those protesters | have | the courage 
the honor | thanking | our veterans 
you | could n't tell | it 
there | were | protesters 
It | was | her supporters 
Palin | may be low-keying | her attacks 
you | believe | Barack Obama 
he | is | an American like 
you | have | the word 
It | sounds | you 
a hate campaign | to be | you 
us | looked | it 
you | 're | the first one 
that | says | it 
Who | are | you 
Who | are | you 
I | 'm | honest journalism 
you | do n't want to talk | him 
the courage | to keep | on 
that man | is | John McCain 
you | supporting | him 
God | bless | you 
God | bless | America 
Governor Palin | sped | the track parking lot 
the race | enters | its final rounds 
We | 'll have | more politics 
Just | want to update | you 
Asian markets | picking | up 
Australian markets | are up | 5 percent 
Hong Kong | is up | 4 
We | 'll have | more 
that | have already killed | at least two people 
One firefighter | described | the blaze 
he | 's battling | a blowtorch 
we | cannot get | front
