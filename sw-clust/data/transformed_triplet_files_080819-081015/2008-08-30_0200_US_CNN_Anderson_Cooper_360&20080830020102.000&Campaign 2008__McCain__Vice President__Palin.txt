We | are | New Orleans 
We | 're | the new pumping station 
the 17th Street Canal | meets | Lake Pontchartrain 
the Army Corps of Engineers | built | it 
what | happened | three years 
lake water | surged back | the canal system 
People | took | note of Katrina's anniversary today 
we | begin | John McCain's choice of a near unknown 
he | said | a person's readiness 
there | are | serious questions 
big- time | surprise | around

Hillary | left | 18 million cracks

it | turns | the women of America 
we | can shatter | that glass ceiling 
( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ) | > | > COOPER 
Governor Palin | got | the nod 
who | is also embroiled | a corruption scandal 
this | is causing | a major stir 
Rush Limbaugh | put | it 
We | 're | the ones 
( LAUGHTER ) | > | > DAVID MATTINGLY 
a park | overlooking | the city of Anchorage 
Governor Sarah Palin | talked | me 
I | 'm | a hockey mom 
I | 'm | one of those movers and shakers 
I | think conventionally | you 
that | could be | what 
she | is | the youngest governor Alaska's 
the only woman | to hold | the office 
She | pushed | a strong ethics law 
public officials | took | members of her own party 
She | challenged | oil companies 
Palin | pushed back | government spending 
a pork barrel project | guided | fellow Alaskan Republican Senator Ted Stevens 
we | 're constantly battling | kind of the 
it | is | what Alaskans 
this | is | what 
Palin | has been | governor 
she | was | a small-town mayor 
She | was then appointed | chairman of the powerful State Oil 
all the while | crafting | her own message of change 
Americans | is getting away | the obsessive partisanship 
the way | doing | what's right 
herself | is | investigation 
The probe | grew out | allegations 
she | fired | her 
public safety commissioner | refusing | sack 
Palin | says | she 
who | was caught | tape pressuring state police 
There | is | nothing 
the governor | pressured directly | the publish safety commissioner 
her husband | had | contacts 
the governor's office staff | had | discussions 
Palin | is | a mother of five 
She | has | an infant 
She | was once | a hometown beauty queen 
she | tried | her hand 
She | is | the anti-Washington Republican conservative 
President Bush today | raised | the Palin choice 
Senator Obama | saying | he 
he | had | this 
I | have n't met | her before 
She | seems | a compelling person 
I | 'm | she 
the case | is | the same 
I | do n't have | 30 years of political experience 
that | is | a good thing 
I | have never been | part of a good old boys club 
You | say | this 
she | 's firing | the evangelicals 
She | is also | Alaska 
I | know | at least one Democratic governor of a major swing state 
he | thinks | she 
she | reinforces | John McCain's reputation 
there | is | a view 
who | has had | bouts 
someone | to be | a heartbeat 
who | has | no experience 
There | are | Democrats 
who | believe | that 
they | plan to make | that argument 
It | is | a 
she's | made | an open appeal 
I | 'm | there 
I | can tell | you 
there | may be | some who 
today | are | women 
that | is | the appeal 
they | find | that insulting 
That | is | what 
They | 're just not going to be taken in | just any woman 
They | thought | it 
someone | closer | their views 
Democrats | made | the same argument 
It | did n't do | them 
I | hate to take | exception 
I | think | he 
Democrats | claim | Governor Palin 
you | should n't vote | her 
she | does not have | the experience 
He | 's | a heartbeat 
His heartbeat | would be | the president's 
he | has | no experience 
who | has actually run | an education system 
who | has actually run | a law enforcement system 
who | has delivered | health care 
you | get to know | this woman 
I | think | America 
Barack Obama | has n't had | executive experience 
she | 's only been there | I 
we | defer | what 
James Surowiecki | calls | the wisdom of crowds 
It | 's called | democracy 
Barack Obama | had | enough experience 
That | is how | we 
I | was | n't one of those 18 million 
I | defer | that choice 
This | is | the choice of one man 
who | met | her apparently one time 
I | want to pull out | the sort of game schema 
I | 'm | a political strategist 
I | was | a senior White House adviser 
I | 'm thinking now | a citizen 
He | is | 72 years 
he | 's had cancer | four times 
he | wants | a woman 
it | 's called | democracy 
a chance | to work | November 
we | do n't get | a chance 
You | get | a chance 
it | to put | a guy 
who | was | a community organizer 
who | was | a state senator 
who | has never actually had | any foreign policy experience 
I | 'm trying | ( CROSSTALK) > > COOPER 
I | want | you 
I | want to go | John King 
I | 'm trying to act | this 
I | 'm trying to act | an American citizen 
I | think | this 
I | think | it 
there | is | a coin-toss chance 
this man | becomes | the president 
eight of our 43 presidents | have died | office 
I | 'm | this 
who | has | family 
he | met | her 
what | do we know | about 
He | had only met | her 
they | had | a secret meeting 
he | has been | an admirer of her 
he | believes | she 
Democrats | will challenge | this assertion 
he | believes | she 
she | 's drawn | a line 
the she | stood up | Senator Ted Stevens 
they | thinks | it 
this | will be decided | John McCain vs. Barack Obama 
what | are | John McCain's two biggest weaknesses 
He | votes | them 
they | do quite | him 
I | cannot tell | you 
Barack Obama | has | African-American support 
He | 's signed | hundreds of thousands of new voters 
the McCain campaign | came | a calculation 
We | need | our base 
Karl Rove | used to say | it 
They | think | this 
it | cure | everything 
Presidential races | are decided | the top of the ticket 
they | needed | something 
they | think | this 
We | 're going to talk | a social conservative 
we | will have | more 
our panel | coming | throughout these two hours 
We | 're broadcasting | two hours 
There | is | so much news 
You | can join | the conversation 
you | will also find | a host of new material 
I | have stood | the old politics 
( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ) | > | > COOPER 
Most Americans | getting | their first look 
she | barely know | one another 
you | heard earlier | John King 
most people | know | her 
the governor | are working to change | that 
John McCain's urgent task | is exposing | his little-known running mate 
his wife | went | one way 
Sarah Palin and family | went | another 
It | is | a new political pair 
the country | to accept | them 
they | know | each other 
McCain | met | Palin just 
this | are | a big reason 
McCain | picked | her 
images of a young mother | trying to do | it 
he | hopes | female voters 
who | wonder why | the man 
experience | would pick | a small-town Alaskan mayor 
That | is | what 
what | do you say | your critics 
who | are saying | you 
enough experience | to do | the job 
I | have appreciated | the 13 years 
I | have had to give | me 
some good experience | to get | this job 
It | 's been | good experience 
she | got back | McCain's Straight Talk Express 
Ohio | did n't just bring | buzz 
It | generated | intrigue 
Time | to get back | the bus 
It | is | a bold choice 
that | has | many 
Washington | shaking | their heads 
they | know | each other 
McCain | to reach out | someone 
he | does n't have | a 
it | seemed | character 
I | have been observing | him 
you | hear | me 
I | hear | you 
we | get | a sense 
he | is | somebody 
who | likes to have | people 
That | is why | I 
that | was | one of his key criterion 
they | insist | it 
she | operates | the state of Alaska 
that | attracted | him 
he | sees | her what 
he | has | a level 
He | might not know | her 
it | is | an important connection 
that | was | a main reason 
he | decided to go | her 
she | is | a supporter of gun rights 
she | is | an opponent of abortion 
she | is | a she 
she | is | a woman 
that | is | a package 
that | really helps | him 
Dana Bash | reporting | New Concord 
She | 's | these parts 
she | 's | Washington 
you | 're going to be as impressed | I 
She | 's got | the grit 
that | is exactly | what 
we | need | Washington 
( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ) | > | > COOPER 
John McCain | talking | the woman 
he | would like to be | America's first female vice president 
us | talk | strategy 
who | is | me 
an independent conservative | is | Amy 
a lot of Americans | have not heard | her 
voters | do you think | McCain 
I | agree | David 
this | is | a gamble 
we | do n't know how | she 
That | can be | a very unforgiving place 
she | does bring | the table 
This | is | a woman 
who | is | a hunter 
She | does n't just vote | the NRA. 
it | cooks | it 
you | see | her 
you | have | all of these amazing , colorful things 
I | think | John McCain 
This | is also | a mother of five 
She | had to make | a very difficult decision 
who | has | syndrome 
she | 's | word 
she | is | deed 
She | walked | the walk 
I | think | that 
women | are | a monolith 
John McCain | has | a chance 
you | have been | this show many times 
the choice of Sarah Palin | affect | that 
I | think | it 
I | think | there 
that | 's been missing | this campaign 
John McCain | has been | excitement and enthusiasm 
there | is | great enthusiasm 
he | has | the record 
he | does n't talk | a lot 
he | -- | what 
this selection | was | a very positive move 
that | speaks | volumes 
She | endorsed | Pat Buchanan 
he | is | a hero 
that | is | sort of number one 
she | 's going to have | some appeal 
her appeal | is | that 
there | was | some question 
Hillary | got | 18 million voters 
I | said | earlier 
There | are | not many 
there | are | many Hillary Buchanan 
I | promise | you 
( LAUGHTER ) | > | > CARVILLE 
It | is | kind 
I | think | she 
she | had | a lot of appeal 
I | 'm | a little mystified 
he | had met | her 
he | picked | her 
this whole thing | was | a little bit 
John King | reported | they 
they | had | two 
( CROSSTALK) ( LAUGHTER ) | > | > CARVILLE 
it | is | two meetings 
( CROSSTALK) ( LAUGHTER ) | > | > CARVILLE 
( LAUGHTER ) | > | > COOPER 
can Republicans | argue | this 
a choice | made | governance 
this a choice | made purely | politics 
I | think | she 
she | is | the only one 
that | has | executive experience 
She | has been | governor 
She | 's been | a mayor 
I | was | Alaska 
her name | was being tossed | a little bit 
she | 's held | high regard 
She | is | someone 
She | has | a good record 
she | does bring | the political element 
She | solidifies | the base 
He | has | the experience 
She | has | the 
that | has been missing | this campaign 
I | think | it 
They | can cast | a historic vote 
a conservative ticket | voting | her 
the first woman | to be elected | vice president of the United States 
I | think | it 
I | will ask | you 
her | being | a heartbeat 
I | do n't have | a concern 
the experience issue | was not ever something | that 
It | is actually | more ideology 
that | is | my concern 
you | know | what 
There | is | nothing 
it | being | a little bit of both 
Sarah Palin | has | a 
This | is | someone 
who | has gone | her own party 
this | is | a woman 
who | said | Ted Stevens 
she | brings | that 
it | helps | John McCain 
This | is | a man 
who | has been | the Senate all these years 
he | can campaign | an outsider 
who | has never voted | an earmark 
she | helps | him 
We | value | all perspectives
