I | am directing | my campaign 
Presidential Debates | to delay | Friday night's debate 
we | have taken | action 
This | is exactly | the time 
the American people | need to hear | the person 
we | 're going to hear | different political sides 
we | want to get | many facts 
that | is | part of the question 
The entire presidential campaign | is basically | limbo tonight 
the candidates | seem to agree | right 
$ 700 billion bailout plan | needs | more oversight and accountability 
the architects of the plan | were back | Capitol Hill 
it | is | your vote 
360's Tom Foreman | takes | a look 
the administration's bailout plan | continues to get | a cool reception 
none of the money | headed | troubled companies 
The taxpayers | have to know | those 
who | have created | the problem 
they | go | the door 
himself | made | hundreds of millions 
such a measure | could make | companies 
The White House | will consider | the restriction 
The American people | are | executive compensation 
some Republicans | say | they 
who | gets | it 
what taxpayers | get | return 
It | is | a blank check 
we | will do | the right thing 
the head of the Federal Reserve | keeps saying | he 
That | has | some saying taxpayers 
I | can put | a gun 
I | will triple | his money 
that | is | a risk 
they | are clearly worried | the buyer's remorse 
they | will face | they 
the president | backed | the bailout 
There | is | no doubt 
us | try to break | it 
We | 're talking | politics 
us | is | CNN's Jessica Yellin 
John Boehner | said tonight | they 
We | heard | that 
What | do you hear | this progress 
staffers | are hammering | the terms of a proposal 
they | will take | tomorrow morning 
these committees | to discuss where | they 
We | understand | they 
that | needs to be | a limit 
There | needs to be | some sort of mortgage provisions 
who | are struggling | that 
there | needs to be | some sort of oversight board 
There | are | a lot of details 
I | can tell | you 
Democrats | are especially doing | their utmost right 
who | is taking | the lead 
he | 's saving | us 
We | 're trying to rescue | the economy 
We | 're going to have | more 
We | are talking | this deal 
the bailout | to fix | the broken economy 
it | is | a cheesy game show 
We | 're told | progress 
What | does it mean | you
