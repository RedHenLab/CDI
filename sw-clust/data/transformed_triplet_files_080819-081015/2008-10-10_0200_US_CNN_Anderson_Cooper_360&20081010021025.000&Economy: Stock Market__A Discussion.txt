I | ca n't pick | a fight 
who | buy | ink 
guys | are going to have to start asking | the questions 
they | 're | a position 
Sarah Palin today | calling | supporters 
the media | to do | stories 
Senator Obama | downplays | the relationship 
who | is | his actions 
the '60s | is now | a college professor 
Ayers | has become | the star of campaign stops 
John McCain | to try to raise | doubts 
we | will have | new comments 
what Barack Obama | has to say | Ayers 
the McCain forces | may be focusing | Obama's character 
McCain supporters | are certainly feeling | it 
Ed Henry | is | the trail tonight 
> > | ED | HENRY 
It | is | an emotion 
what | 's going to surprise | you 
it | 's | the economy 
It | is | the socialists 
( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ) | > | > HENRY 
you | have | an Obama , Pelosi 
the rest of the hooligans | going to run | this country 
we | have got to have | our head 
It | is | time 
two | are representing | us 
the party faithful | amazed | McCain 
that Obama | is where | he 
this room | is stunned | we 
the media | is allegedly giving | Obama 
We | are | a product of our association 
a way | to get | this media and line 
( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ) | > | > HENRY 
some anger | is directed | McCain 
We | have | the good Reverend Wright 
We | have | Pfleger 
We | have | all of these shady characters 
that | have surrounded | him 
We | have | corruption 
I | am begging | you 
I | am begging | you 
( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ) | > | > HENRY 
he | is going | the Ayers controversy 
Senator Obama | said | he 
We | know | that 
( AUDIENCE BOOING ) | > | > MCCAIN 
We | need to know | the full extent of the relationship 
Senator Obama | is telling | the truth 
he | ducked | a demand 
he | bring up | the Reverend Wright flap 
John McCain | has not been talking | Reverend Wright 
he | suggested | he 
that | was | fair game 
the McCains | have also said | months 
they | did n't think | they 
who | is | a Marine 
they | did n't think | he 
Cindy McCain | did use | him 
this campaign | unfolds | the final days 
who | knows | what 
any campaign | gets | more desperate or more and more 
there | is | no 
what | -- | what 
They | talked | about 
Governor Palin | brought | it 
who | want | McCain himself 
there | are | some 
the only way John McCain | is going to win | is 
he | thinks | Barack Obama 
he | thinks | he 
poor judgment | has not leveled | the American people 
there | are | many others 
you | are going to flip | this 
you | are going | anger independent undecided voters 
you | see | John McCain 
he | is | sort 
He | does n't quite know | which button 
he | 's get | going pressure 
It | is | someone 
I | think | it 
we | just keep talking | the economy 
they | had to pivot | the economy 
There | were | Republican strategists 
we | have to continue to talk | this financial crisis 
that | is obviously | something 
the Democrats | have pounced | on 
we | 're seeing | all these various attacks 
It | suggests | the McCain camp 
I | think | it 
you | had | Sarah Palin today 
you | have got | demand 
the media | ask | these tough questions of Barack Obama 
he | give | answers 
This | is | Sarah Palin 
which | interviews | she 
who | are saying | we 
Drew Griffin | did | a very tough piece 
You | can look | it 
she | 's moving | voters 
what | is | the core of her appeal 
we | will met | a group of women 
who | says | the Alaska governor
