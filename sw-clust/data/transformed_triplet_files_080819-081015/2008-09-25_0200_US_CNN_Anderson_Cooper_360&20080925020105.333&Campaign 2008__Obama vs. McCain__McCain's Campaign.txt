John McCain and congressional leaders | to come | the White House tomorrow 
Obama and McCain | released | a joint statement 
We | will get | that 
that | has | political observers 
he | 's suspending | his campaign 
Washington | to focus | the bailout battle 
he | plans to debate | Friday 
what | is | McCain 
We | will have | all the angles 
us | listen | some of what 
President Bush | said | we 
> | > | GEORGE W. BUSH 
There | has been | a widespread loss of confidence 
major sectors of America's financial system | are | risk 
America | could slip | a financial panic 
The stock market | would drop | even more 
which | would reduce | the value of your retirement account 
you | own | a business 
you | would find | it 
more expensive | to get | credit 
More businesses | would close | their doors 
millions of Americans | could lose | their jobs 
you | have | good credit history 
it | would be | you 
you | need to buy | a car 
our country | could experience | a long and painful recession 
We | will have | more of what 
we | will have | more of what 
what | happened | the scenes 
Candy Crowley | has | the breaking news 
Barack Obama | has agreed to return | Washington 
which | includes | congressional leaders 
who | requested | the session 
The news | came | the end of a day 
which | started when | McCain 
It | has become | no consensus 
I | do not believe | the plan 
the table | will pass | it 
we | are running out | time 
I | will suspend | my campaign and return 
McCain's actions | come | a precarious time 
The Wall Street bailout | is teetering | Congress 
McCain's campaign | is losing | ground 
both candidates | try to show | leadership 
McCain | called | Obama 
him | suspending | political ads 
We | must meet | Americans 
we | must meet | this crisis 
I | am directing | my campaign 
Presidential Debates | to delay | Friday night's debate 
we | have taken | action 
a quick news conference | to say yes | bipartisan and no 
It | is | my belief 
this | is exactly | the time 
the American people | need to hear | the person 
I | think | it 
it | is going to be | part of the president's job 
Obama aides | let it be known | it 
who | called | McCain 
McCain | called back | mid-afternoon 
Obama | suggested | a joint statement 
It | materialized | late this evening 
It | was | a weak piece of paper 
both | have said | days 
It | lacked even | the barest specifics 
both | have talked | the campaign trail 
part of what Obama | said | that joint statement 
the statement Obama | tried to call | McCain 
It | goes | to 
a time | to come together | Democrats and Republicans 
that | has been submitted | Congress 
the effort | to protect | the American economy 
Candy | pointed | out 
us | go deeper | Candy 
what | is | your take 
that | could n't get | any more surreal 
it | reached | a whole other level 
I | think | John McCain 
there | is | nothing 
which | is | what 
he | is also | a politician 
we | have seen | this campaign 
I | think | he 
I | think | he 
it | gets passed | he 
I | think | he 
it | is | his interests 
Americans | do not want | this plan 
He | would love to suck | Obama 
the middle of this and | have | Obama's name 
he | has to share | the blame 
I | think | this 
I | think | Obama 
us | go forward | the debates 
us | hold | off 
what | does | the Obama camp 
what | went | the scenes today 
they | think | McCain 
they | were pushing | storyline most of the day 
McCain | is just trying to seize | the leadership 
he | is making | this move 
They | felt | that way 
they | were startled | it 
I | will say | that 
it | took | them 
McCain | then coming back | his hotel room 
TV | saying | he 
they | did | scramble 
this | is just | a bid 
It | is | Barack Obama 
he | has to be | he 
what | do | these guys 
they | go back | Washington 
neither of them | are even | the committee 
that | is taking | part 
both men | have | big responsibilities 
who | are | nervous going 
who | will be looking | John McCain 
I | think | we 
presidential politics | is | a huge part of this 
it | is | a subplot 
the president of the United States | said | tonight 
He | is trying to convince | the American people 
who | do not trust | him 
it | 's just | the president 
I | am traveling | this week 
I | can tell | you 
people | think | they 
they | are going to get | the short end of this stick 
Barack Obama | are now | part of an exercise 
which | is | a pretty big deal 
You | heard | the president 
we | do n't do | this 
it | is | the American people 
we | will fix | this 
I | 'm told | Barack Obama 
he | is heartened and encouraged | what 
We | will try to have | more of that statement 
we | get | it 
you | see | this playing 
John McCain | goes back | tomorrow 
I | think | there 
there | is | a showdown vote 
there | is | a debate 
that | make it look | John McCain 
he | said | there 
I | think | he 
the Presidential Commission | set | these debate 
I | do n't think | the country 
I | think | the country 
me | go | John King's point 
about | how | important this 
There | are | very intricate negotiations 
that | have been | way 
Secretary Paulson | feel | Barney Frank 
it | 's teetering | a degree 
they | have made | a lot of progress 
I | think | there 
something | is going to pass here | the next few days 
it | has | a gun 
they | will be | it 
What Senator McCain | can do | what Senator Obama 
it | said | there 
30 or 40 Republicans | prepared to vote | this 
it | making | sure 
Republicans | take | as much responsibility 
Barack Obama | is still continuing to run | ads 
that | is | what 
I | got | his press conference 
John McCain | says | he 
He | has not suspended | his campaign 
he | intends to go | the debate 
there | are | larger stakes 
It | 's been | the Democrats 
it | is | the Republicans 
that | are holding | it 
We | need to get | more Republicans 
John McCain | needs to do | this 
John McCain | has | much more 
stake | going | Washington 
most | needs to round | those votes 
I | guess | there 
he | wants to get | Obama 
there | is to be | any blame 
there | is | a risk 
John McCain | going back | Washington 
There | is | a risk 
the president of the United States | going | TV tonight 
people | tend to blame | the party 
we | were reminded yet again tonight | that party 
it | comes | the White House 
there | is certainly | a risk 
John McCain | being associated | anything 
he | wants to bring | Barack Obama 
Both of these candidates | are having | difficulty 
Barack Obama | gets | a bit of an edge 
he | is | a Democrat 
he | 's formed | any personal bond 
I | 'm going to say | this 
there | is | a huge disconnect 
you | bought | a house 
it | is | a $ 1 million home 
that | is now | worth two-thirds of what 
you | paid | it 
they | want | action 
They | want | something 
they | do n't trust | any of them 
that | will help | them 
I | can tell | you 
they | think | this 
We | are going to have | more 
the first presidential debate | still set | Friday 
Everyone but John McCain | seems to want | it 
Senator Obama | says | he 
Senator McCain | says | a bailout deal 
We | will be there | it 
we | 're going to be blogging | the hour 
you | can watch | Erica's live show 
She | 's already started | it 
the link | to watch | that 
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson | facing | with House lawmakers 
who | were not cutting | them 
they | defended | themselves 
It | is | your money 
that | is | what 
Sarah Palin | gave | an interview 
Katie Couric | asked | the questions 
she | responded | we
