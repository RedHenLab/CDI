you | ca n't do | what George Bush 
I | looked | Vladimir Putin's soul 
You | do n't look | somebody's soul 
You | look | your national interests 
the Trail " today | talking | tougher 
you | name | it 
you | 've been saying | all 
Obama | needs to be | he 
I | think | he 
I | mean | President Bush 
it | might not be | a bad idea 
Obama | to remind | people 
I | want to come back | John McCain 
We | saw | Ed Henry's piece 
it | is | a head fake 
they | get | the end 
it | serve | John McCain 
that | does n't trust | him 
I | might pick | Tom Ridge 
who | supports | abortion rights 
I | might even pick | the guy 
who | was | Al Gore's running mate 
I | think | McCain 
he | 's looking | for vice president 
My guess | is | the old fighter pilot 
he | could be | the cockpit 
who | 'll keep | the country safe 
I | think | those people 
you | look | the other political considerations 
Ridge | passes | those tests 
Lieberman | passes | those tests 
Romney | passes | those tests 
those guys | have to be | the short list 
you | 're watching | this play 
you | 're watching | this play out 
Democrats | are already | a bit 
you | have | a very tight national race 
you | worry | that McCain 
his own convention | pick | somebody 
who | supports | abortion rights 
No. John McCain | has changed | his mind 
every single issue | to win | this nomination 
He | 's changed | it 
He | 's changed | it 
He | 's changed | it 
He | 's gone kissing | the ring of the right wing 
he | said | he 
There | is | no way 
he | 's going to flip | that 
He | wants to get elected | his base 
He | 's going to focus | somebody 
I | think | he 
he | made | that decision 
who | supports | abortion rights 
the party | would support | him 
he | is | their nominee 
you | believe | that 
I | think | the party 
I | was listening | Alex 
experience and predictable John McCain | was | a little while 
that | accused | Jerry Falwell 
Pat Robertson | being | agents of intolerance 
I | mean | this guy 
he | loves to live | his comfort zone 
Joe Lieberman | is | a crucial part of his posse 
I | do n't think | he 
it | is | John McCain 
he | trying to remind | the Republicans 
he | picks | someone 
who | is | he 
he | trying to tell | the party 
we | 've been | sort of poking 
I | 'm | charge 
I | think obviously | that 
one of the perks | being | the nominee 
You | get to do | that 
also Lieberman | is | a slightly safer choice 
you | 're not putting | him 
him | up | the heir 
you | would be putting | him 
I | think actually | Lieberman 
there | is | one big issue 
that | dominates Republicans now | unites everybody 
it | is keeping | the country safe 
somebody | is trying to break | your house 
you | 're going to worry | other issues 
I | think | the ticket 
I | enjoy | conventions 
I | enjoy | one 
Joe Klein | will be | us
