That | is | her dog's name 
The Maltese | may very well now be | the richest pooch 
I | guess | you 
We | do n't pay | taxes 
Only the little people | pay | taxes 
She | died | 2007 
she | wanted | her dog 
she | wanted | her dog 
her wishes | are | what 
it | says | what 
she | thought | the law 
It | is | a great article 
He | joins | us 
I | 've been obsessed | this 
you | have finally taken | it 
this | is | the one 
Leona Helmsley | created | a mission statement 
her trust | indicated | the money 
She | changed | 2004 
she | do | that 
this | is | the great thing 
her | will reflects | this tremendous hatred of the human race 
you | point | out 
us | give | some of my $ 8 billion 
us | give | it 
It | is right there | the document 
Trouble | was left | $ 12 million 
That amount | was reduced | $ 2 million 
a dog | spend | $ 2 million 
there | was | so much publicity 
Trouble | got | death threats 
it | costs | $ 100,000 
a year | to provide | security 
who | takes | care of Trouble 
just | to be | the caretaker 
most of the expense | is | Trouble's security guards 
there | is | an actual security guard 
I | apply | that job 
That | seems | the easiest job 
that | 's got to be | a team 
It | 's got to be | at least three people 
this | is | the mystery 
the Helmsley estate | is now trying to figure | out 
you | spend | $ 8 billion 
there | are | a lot of animal rights people 
we | want to have | spaying and neutering vans 
we | do n't want to have | euthanasia 
I | thought | she 
lots of people | want to leave | their money 
states | are making | it 
easier and easier | to leave | money 
lots of people | are putting | their dogs 
the law | is making | it 
I | want to preempt | all the e-mails 
You | are | a dog owner 
I | 'm | a dog owner 
We | love | dogs 
$ 8 billion | is | a lot of money 
We | do love | dogs 
there | is | any dogs 
who | own | stocks 
Leona Helmsley's trust | could somehow be | part of this whole big bailout 
You | know | what 
The article | is | The New Yorker
