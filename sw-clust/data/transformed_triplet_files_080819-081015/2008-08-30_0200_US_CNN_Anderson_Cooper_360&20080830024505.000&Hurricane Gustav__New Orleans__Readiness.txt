A FUNERALER | IS | MOPEY WITH > > COOPER 
Gustav | is now | a Category 1 storm 
it | could become | a Category 3 
it | churns | the Caribbean 
it | 's forecast to be | a Category 4 
we | 'll get | that 
I | 'll show | you 
The storm | did move | Jamaica 
It | moved | Haiti 
itself | up | a little bit 
it | is back | very warm and very deep water 
There | are | the winds 
Winds | are | 80 miles 
the pressure | is | 974 
That | means | it 
The pressure | is getter | deeper , kind 
it | 's expected to turn | a Category 3 
the difference | is | I 
we | made | landfall 
This | would really be | Monday night 
it | could be left | it 
I | can find | I 
you | can take | a deep breath 
You | 're still | the potential cone 
I | think | you 
we | draw | a line 
that | leaves | New Orleans 
There | is | no good side of the eye 
this wind | is blowing | the water 
we | 're going to have | that same problem 
we | had | Katrina 
the water | piling up | water 
So | do | we 
we | would start doing | mandatory evacuations 
this thing | exactly going to hit | we 
We | know | there 
It | 's called | the G-4 
It | 's | the hurricane hunter 
we | see | all those ugly pictures 
This jet | flies back and forth | the entire gulf 
It | does n't care where | the hurricane 
It | 's dropping | little dropsans 
we | get | a feel 
We | do n't have | any observations 
There | is | nobody 
It | is | a big ocean 
we | 'll have | an idea 
The models | will be | morning 
I | think | you 
the hurricane center | says | at 5 a.m. 
I | would say | you 
We | will know | much better 
we | talk | it 
this hurricane hunter aircraft | flying | the storm 
We | 'll check | Chad 
This | is | a national disaster 
the country | get | their asses 
Hurricane Katrina | hit | three years 
This | is | the third anniversary 
James Carville | has joined | me 
you | live here | your family 
concerned | are | you 
what | are | you 
I | 'm watching | it 
I | 'm going to send | my daughters 
it | is | something 
you | live | with 
It | is | the greatest city 
we | survived | any number of storms 
It | is pretty much | the norm 
the levees | did n't hold | that 
you | believe | these levees 
They | 've built | these new gates 
that | are going to try to stop | the storm surge 
we | wo n't know | they 
I | think | there 
I | think | there 
They | 're going to get | a lot of people 
I | think | they 
the storm | has turned | a little bit more 
you | have | these things 
You | watch | them 
you | have to be | them 
we | 've had | a lot of them 
About 100,000 people | did n't have | access 
They | 're saying now | 30,000 people 
they | have | plans 
They | 've got | buses 
We | 'll see | what 
there | is | a lot fewer people 
it | does n't get | any worse
