whoever | gets | the pick 
We | have got | more on all the developments 
who | is joining | us 
what | are | you 
we | ca n't say | any certainly 
You | mentioned | Senator Joe Biden 
the Obama campaign | close | the campaign 
the past couple of days | have been saying | he 
a leading candidate | to share | the ticket 
he | raised | a few eyebrows 
he | drove | past reporters 
I | 'm | the guy 
It | 's | me 
Joe Biden | reemerged | a couple hours 
You | might say | his answer 
who | knows | ? 
I | promise | you 
I | do n't know | anything 
I | have | no idea 
I | have spoken | no one 
You | gave | us 
It | 's | me 
you | spoken | the campaign 
I | have not spoken | anyone 
I | have not spoken | anyone 
you | 're not ruling | you 
I | have | no idea 
guys | know as well | I 
I | checked | a couple 
other Democrats | thought to be and believed to be | the short list 
they | say | they 
we | are told | this 
he | plans | the state capitol 
that | is | the target 
us | switch | over 
I | would be | a pro-life president 
I | got | an e-mail 
who | says | this 
who | supports | abortion rights 
We | reported | Saturday night 
we | are now told | at least three top McCain campaign officials 
the past two days | calling | the leaders of state delegations 
what | would | the reaction 
John McCain | picked | somebody 
who | supports | abortion rights 
Those calls | have specifically named | the former Pennsylvania Governor 
all indications | are | John McCain 
he | does go | route 
there | would be | a revolt 
many of those social conservatives | are threatening | they 
home | come | November 
I | will say | this 
Ridge's name | is being floated directly | those calls 
many | think | this 
John McCain | to be testing | the waters 
that | would be to pick | Democrat-turned-independent Joe Lieberman 
Most | think | it 
he | will go | an anti- abortion conservative 
All right , John , | stay | me 
who | is | the telephone 
who | writes | the page 
the McCain campaign | chooses | a pro- choice candidate 
just | to follow | on 
the Republican Party | pushed | the conservative movement 
it | be | that bad 
It | wo n't be | that bad , Campbell 
it | points | the dilemma 
John McCain | may be creating | himself 
that | is | Tom Ridge 
Joe Lieberman | would both be | very striking choices 
it | does raise | the specter 
he | does not go | that way 
he | does not go | a pro-choice candidate 
he | goes | a pro-life candidate 
he | will have allowed | the Rush Limbaughs of the world 
I | 'm | a little 
they | 're making | this quite as public 
what | do | you 
I | have got | a theory 
I | have done | today 
I | think | Tom Ridge 
I | do n't believe | he 
they | putting | it 
I | think | they 
it | is | just a theory 
it | 's | a crazy one 
I | have said to | you 
I | think | Tom Ridge 
Joe Lieberman | are | people 
I | think | he 
I | think | what 
these consultations | are meant to do | is 
he | picks | Mitt Romney 
Everybody | has | a sigh of relief 
we | have got | a pro-choice 
we | have got | a pro-life guy 
We | got | a guy 
you | just pick | Romney 
there | would be | some religious conservatives 
who | would be | Romney 
He | 's | we 
he | 's going to look | that key issue 
I | wonder | you 
You | 're getting deep | the weeds 
it | 's | my theory 
It | is | one 
many Republicans | have brought | me 
they | are talking | it 
There | is clearly | a motive 
you | asked | David 
I | believe | the Republican Convention 
John McCain | would have | a disastrous convention 
he | chose | Joe Lieberman 
me | bring | you 
you | were just talking | us 
Senator Biden | saying | he 
any reason | to believe | him 
( LAUGHTER ) | > | > BROWN 
He | was playing | the cameras 
this | is | a very difficult 
we | are | the last days 
it | gets | a little wacky 
the camera | is pointed | them 
they | do n't want to say | anything 
that | knocks | them 
Joe Biden | likes to talk | reporters 
It | was | he 
it | is | a very tough time 
Senator Obama | likes | Biden 
They | 're weighing | the pros and cons 
Mark | is | dead right 
Most Republicans | tell | you 
they | think | this 
there | are | a few people 
who | are making | this case 
you | want to win | this election year 
you | need to shake | the game 
it | would be | huge risk 
there | are | some people 
who | make | that case 
he | is | at least listening 
We | focused | McCain 
I | think | that 
Biden | is | the lead choice 
quiet and | ... | > BROWN 
That | is so not | him 
I | think | it 
that | makes | the most sense 
I | believe | the second most likely choice 
I | believe | the third most likely 
who | has not been widely speculated | up until 
Who | > | HALPERIN 
I | 'm working | that
