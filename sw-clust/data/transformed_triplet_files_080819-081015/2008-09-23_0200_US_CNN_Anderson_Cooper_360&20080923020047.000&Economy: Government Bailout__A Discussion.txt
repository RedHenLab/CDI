she | 's never met | a world leader 
she | will meet | plenty 
We | will tell | you 
We | begin tonight | the president's massive financial rescue plan 
the country | is looking | the next Great Depression 
It | is | that serious 
One market guru | comparing | the crisis 
leery | signing | a $ 700 billion check 
the fine print | changing | some of it 
Democratic Senator Chris Dodd | offering | legislation of his own , conservative Republicans 
the crisis | apparently helping | Senator Obama gain ground 
the question of who | would better handle | a crisis 
we | know right now | Tom Foreman 
the markets | watching | Washington 
Washington | watching | the markets 
a high-stakes poker game | is being waged | the $ 700 billion bailout 
who | want | more regulation 
who | contributed | the troubles 
them | feel | the hard landing 
my constituency | faced when | they 
them | feel | the hard landing 
it | will limit | future economic growth 
conservatives | are concerned | the cure of a massive transfer 
Wall Street | be | the disease 
we | 're facing | our financial markets 
some Republicans | agree | the need 
that | get | money 
polls | showing | the public more 
the Dems | are pushing hard | concessions 
an emergency committee | to oversee | the handling of the bailout deal 
homeowners | caught | the mortgage mess 
the government | to hold | actual shares 
those shares | would be sold | the future 
that | is being laid | this deal 
No one | knows | sure what 
that | promotes | fiscal responsibility 
The long-term cost | wo n't be | $ 700 billion 
It | 's going to be | that 
The real problem | is estimating | what 
the difficulties | hammering | the details 
both parties | are predicting | a deal 
We | 're digging | deeper now 
He | 's written | Crash Proof 
I | want to start | you 
What | do | you 
it | is | kind of funny 
you | have | this kind of disagreement 
something | is | a bad idea 
they | have | something 
the Republicans | say | this 
this | is | a fat cat bailout 
American families | are losing | their homes 
who | are | some of this 
getting Americans | to take | loans 
they | 're now going to get let off | the hook 
you | say | this 
it | is | the lesser of two evils 
I | think | it 
what | was | a relatively clean bill 
That | is | a sinkhole 
that | has | no bottom 
A lot of Democrats | are calling | that 
Republicans | have | their own ideas 
I | think | the danger 
you | have | must-pass legislation 
you | focus | politics 
The real danger | is | the timing of this crisis 
We | are | six weeks 
almost every member of Congress | is | the ballot 
They | are panicking | wildebeests 
I | think | the American people 
the taxpayer | is caught holding | the bag 
this | were | the election 
I | think | we 
I | think | we 
we | add | all of these Christmas tree amendments 
you | hated | it 
it | stink | any less 
you | > | PETER SCHIFF 
I | hate | it 
the equivalent | selling | our financial souls 
It | is | Henry Paulson 
they | 're | the pied pipers 
that | led | us 
they | are going to lead | us 
it | 's going to be | we 
it | 's going to be | a lot 
we | do | this 
We | need to get back | the free market 
it | 's | the free market 
that | got | us 
It | was | all the government interference 
It | was | the Federal Reserve 
It | was | Freddie and Fannie 
that | made | all these crazy loans 
that | let | people 
We | need | less government 
you | believe | the free market 
you | disagree | Peter 
I | think | it 
I | think | Peter 
I | 'm simply making | a political point 
We | are going to have | a bill 
members of Congress | are not going to be stuck seen doing | nothing 
the bill | should do | the least possible damage 
It | is | a big mistake 
the government | take | an equity share 
That | is | one of the big things 
the government | should take | some sort of an equity share 
who | feel | we 
Wall Street | made | irresponsible decisions 
the American taxpayer | is now going to bail | Wall Street 
the American taxpayer | deserves | some reward 
which | is loaning | a company money 
That argument | is | the government 
even what | could be | a trillion dollars 
It | is going to be less | the end 
it | is | bad idea 
we | 're addressing | the symptoms of our disease 
We | 're borrowing | too much money 
what | does | this plan 
It | gets | us 
the taxpayers | are not suffer | higher taxes 
They | 're going to suffer | massive inflation 
They | 're going to see | the value of their wages 
we | have to print | the money 
that | seems to make | sense 
I | think | it 
which | is | the European approach 
The Europeans | have | a different system 
You | 're saying | it 
the whole thing | smacks | socialism 
we | 're bailing | people 
the government | created | the conditions 
which | led | people 
I | do n't think | the solution 
which | created | the very conditions 
that | messed | this up 
There | is | no evidence 
they | would do | a better job 
foreign banks | going to be getting | money 
This bill | cannot pass | foreigners 
that | will create | a political firestorm 
There | is | no way 
we | 're going to see | the Japanese 
what | was | a premier 
That model | is now | jeopardy 
you | allow | U.S. firms 
they | could buy | them 
the world | flip | them 
There | is | no way 
There | is also | this 
Wall Street | are going to make | money 
who | were | excesses 
they | 're | the ones 
They | 're | the ones 
who | are actually going to now have | stakes 
that | would have kept plummeting | value 
We | have already seen | it 
they | get | their bonuses 
we | started | the Bear Stearns bailout 
we | moved | the AIG bailout 
you | violate | the basic principle of no bailouts 
you | create | a long line 
what | is | the next company 
that | is going | after this bailout 
you | have drawn | the line 
I | think | you 
we | 're paying | the consequences 
They | should have said | no 
there | will be | some sort of a deal 
what | do | you 
they | want to go back | home 
They | do n't want | to... ( CROSSTALK) > > FUND 
they | go | home passing 
they | go back passing | nothing 
I | think | they 
they | 're ignoring | the plight of the American people 
they | 're already extending | this 
that | is | a bottomless pit 
you | know | what 
you | have got | Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley 
they | have blown | their own capital 
they | are going to acquire | a bunch of FDIC-insured deposits 
they | 're going to lose | that 
We | have got to leave | it 
I | wish | we 
we | will be blogging | the hour 
you | can find | Erica Hill's live Webcast 
We | have got | striking new poll numbers
