he | is | a great debater 
he | looks | pretty dog 
he | is | he 
this | is | the same Senator Biden 
who | said | the other day 
the University of Delaware | would trounce | the Ohio State Buckeyes 
Wrong | > | COOPER 
She | is still | fire 
us | watch | Fareed Zakaria 
> > | FAREED | ZAKARIA 
It | 's | she 
it | is | she 
This | is | way 
we | have ever seen | a national candidate 
Our panel | joins | us 
Palin | was asked | comments 
she | 'd recently made regarding | U.S. troops 
She | was asked | this 
I | believe | it 
us | listen | the exchange 
the U.S. | should absolutely launch | cross-border attacks 
the terrorists | coming | any further 
that | is almost | the exact position Barack Obama 
We | had | a great discussion 
we | talked | what 
it | is | America 
the terrorists | do not cross | borders 
a position | attacking | America 
we | will do | what 
I | understand | this day and age , gotcha journalism 
who | did n't hear | the question 
You | do n't know | the context of the conversation 
I | agree | you 
you | 're going to attack | another country 
you | said | it 
this | was | a gotcha sound bite 
It | was | a gotcha 
She | was talking | a voter 
She | was | a conversation 
I | 'll let | Governor Palin 
this | was | a voter 
What | are | you 
You | have | an answer 
We | 're going to do | what 
we | have to protect | the United States of America 
What | have | you 
this | is | all 
what | did you think | this newest interview 
you | to see | John McCain 
you | think | that plays 
That | 's going to be up | the voters 
me | say | a couple things 
She | did differ | Senator McCain 
the campaign | dealing | Pakistan 
it | was | what , 
I | think | it 
that | was | Barack Obama's 
I | do n't think | we 
a voter | asks | you 
you | want to play | the big leagues 
I | want to play | another exchange 
Katie | asks | Palin's response 
Republican criticism | aimed | her 
you | 've gotten | a lot of flak 
Some Republicans | have said | you 
you | 're | primetime 
People | have questioned | your readiness 
I | to serve | vice president 
us | privilege | us 
the opportunity | serving | them 
you | think | she 
that | bothers | me 
I | agree | David 
that | bothers | me 
John McCain | should n't be | that scene 
It | looks | a father 
she | messed up | last week 
She | had to go back | Katie 
she | can handle | the big-league pitching 
the key thing | is | you 
she | has to follow | John McCain's policies 
it | looked | she 
she | 's got to go | that stage 
she | 's got to hit | a home run 
She | 's got | a big personality 
he | ca n't protect | her 
He | chose | her 
he | ca n't protect | her 
Ed | is so | the money 
Katie | is talking | her 
you | think | you 
she | should n't have to admit | that 
She | said | it 
you | ca n't keep blaming | the media 
It | was | a voter 
Voters | are going to ask | questions 
a voter | had | a gotcha moment 
a voter | was trying to get | an answer 
You | cannot protect | her 
her | do | what 
Russell Simmons | has | a book 
Palin | should simply do | you 
She | 's trying to be | vice president 
I | should also point | those 
who | are going | e- mail 
they | were picking | on Sarah Palin's gaffes or perceived gaffes 
We | looked very closely | two nights 
the campaign | had to backtrack | that 
he | said | the last several weeks 
important | is | it 
they | 're not really voting | vice president 
They | 're voting | president 
This | is perhaps | the most important vice-presidential debate 
I | think | we 
she | has | a chance 
this Thursday night | to really do | herself 
Joe Biden | could make | a big mistake 
this | is | a delicate matter 
There | is | a lot of delicacy 
there | is | a possibility 
presidential debate | got | a smaller audience 
I | think | this 
a possibility | actually getting | a bigger audience 
I | think | you 
we | 're going to have to leave | it 
John McCain | will be | CNN's " AMERICAN MORNING " tomorrow
