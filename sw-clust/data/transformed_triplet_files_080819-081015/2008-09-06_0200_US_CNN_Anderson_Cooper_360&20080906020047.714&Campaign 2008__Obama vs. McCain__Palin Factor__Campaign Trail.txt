It | began today | both sides 
it | seems to have given | his campaign 
Sarah Palin | comes | a crucial time 
there | is | no rest 
Both tickets | began | a swing state blitz today 
McCain and Palin | hit | the trail 
Cheering crowds | line | the streets 
( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ) | > | > BASH 
Post-convention excitement | is | this Republican pocket of Democratic-leaning Wisconsin 
you | did n't see | McCain 
Sarah | > | BASH 
the kind of place McCain | hopes | his new running mate 
We | had | a technical problem 
what | is | the plan 
I | think | the plan 
we | saw | today 
You | heard | Sarah , Sarah " chants 
it | was | Wisconsin 
They | were here tonight | Macomb County 
This | is | a very important area 
they | 're going to do | that again tomorrow 
I | 'm also told | she 
it | seems to be | a little bit unclear 
they | 're going to try | harness 
they | going to hide | her 
there | have been | no actual interviews 
John McCain | has made | a name 
himself | having | these open town halls 
he | fields | questions 
she | going to talk | any reporters 
I | have been told | something 
that | is have | a press conference 
I | have been told | they 
she | do | interviews 
she | do | interviews 
That | is | a possibility 
we | were reporting | all last week 
no love | lost | the McCain campaign 
they | view perhaps | they 
the media | has covered | her 
we | will see how | that 
I | think | it 
who | are covering | her 
the road | to have | a gaggle 
the way John McCain | used | to 
the McCain ticket | doubled | their campaign spots 
You | might have heard | he 
They | spent | a lot 
that grim jobs | report released | today 
CNN's Candy Crowley | joins | me 
they | are | Pennsylvania 
they | think | he 
that | is | those rural areas 
how | to deal | the 
they | approach | the governor 
I | can tell | you 
they | 're doing | the Obama campaign 
there | is | one thing 
I | think | you 
This | is where | the Obama camp 
they | believe | they 
I | want to play | something 
Barack Obama | said | today 
he | had heard | the Republican Convention 
You | would think | George Bush 
a lot of time | worrying | the economy 
that | are being lost | their watch 
you | watched | the Republican National Convention 
you | would n't know | we 
they | did n't say | a thing 
what | is going | the middle class 
we | are going to be hearing | 
It | is | the Republicans 
they | have | nothing 
they | have | no plan 
They | do n't understand | what 
I | can address | the things 
that | are | your lives 
that | is | the tact 
I | will also tell | you 
they | hired | Sarah Palin 
they | believe | she 
they | believe | she 
her working-class roots | will also sell well | some of those areas 
you | see | Joe Biden 
The Obama team | has now asked | Hillary Clinton 
I | think | it 
they | targeting | Sarah Palin 
Palin | > | CROWLEY 
It | is | response 
I | do not believe | you 
Hillary Clinton | go | Sarah Palin 
I | think | she 
that | is | what 
they | want | Obama 
They | do n't want | him 
he | is | the top of the ticket 
he | needs to be going | John McCain 
He | does n't need to engage | her 
you | go | Sarah Palin 
you | talk | her experience 
you | 're going to bring | discussion of Barack Obama's experience 
they | want to leave | it 
us | face | it 
what | may be | tricky territory 
I | do n't think | you 
I | think | you 
them | talking | John McCain 
the economy | what | his plans 
amazing | are | the next 60 days 
You | know | what 
I | could n't have forecast | this campaign 
( LAUGHTER ) | > | > CROWLEY 
we | knew | the beginning 
it | was going to have | the first 
they | had | a serious shot 
it | 's been | sort of one great week 
I | think | it 
I | think | it 
it | may stay | that way
