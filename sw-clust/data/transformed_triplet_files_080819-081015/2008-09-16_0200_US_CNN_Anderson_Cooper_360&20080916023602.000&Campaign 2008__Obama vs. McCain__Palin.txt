MINNESOTA | LEANING | FROM OBAMA 
IT APPEARS | TO BE | BEHIND 
There | is | the electoral map 
state polling | tends to lag | the national numbers 
John McCain's convention bump | appears to be | fading 
She | spoke | two rallies 
that | did n't happen | today 
CNN's Dana Bash | is | the trail 
Sarah Palin | took | the stage 
Washington | has ignored | this 
Washington | has been asleep | the switch and ineffective 
McCain advisors | call | the key 
the biggest bonus | adding | an outside other 
We | 've got | a lot 
Palin | added | fresh fodder 
she | 'd do | the White House 
My mission | is going to be | energy , security 
Our opponent | wants to raise | income taxes 
Nonpartisan groups | say | that 
Most Americans | would get | a tax cut 
that | are drawing | crowds 
I | have been political | my whole life 
Palin | has got | me 
this morning | to come see | what 
Palin's solo debut | is | a case study 
the McCain campaign strategy | to keep | her 
(voice-over ) Palin's two western rallies | were | tightly-controlled events 
she | signed | she 
the crowd | were distributed | the campaign 
Palin | spent | Sunday 
aides | staying | way 
we | watched | Tina Fey's imitation of Sarah 
I | can see | Russia 
we | were | sure Palin 
an aide | said | she 
Palin | will take | questions 
reporters | following | her around 
I | want to point | it 
reporters | to question | vice-presidential candidates 
they | welcome | the attention 
Joe Biden | held | two press conferences 
He | 's also given | many local and national news interviews 
he | takes | voters 
the media | means | a lot of opportunities 
that | have earned | Joe Biden 
the years | reinforced | just days
