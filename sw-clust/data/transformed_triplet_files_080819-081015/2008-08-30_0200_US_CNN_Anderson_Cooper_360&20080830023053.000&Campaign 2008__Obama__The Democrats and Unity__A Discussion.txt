you | have n't worked so hard | the last 18 months 
the last eight years | to suffer | more failed leadership 
That | was | course 
that | got | so much attention 
There | had been so much talk early | the Democratic convention 
she | would support | Barack Obama 
most Democrats | felt | they 
Tom Foreman | takes | a look 
we | have witnessed | the last week 
a look | united | the Democrats 
The Democrats | came | Denver 
their former first couple | put aside | disappointment 
The Clintons | gave | it 
Barack Obama | will lead | us 
you | voted | me 
you | voted | Barack 
> | > | B. CLINTON 
I | learned | my eight years 
I | have done since | America 
Barack Obama | is | the man 
This | is | a fight 
it | is | a fight 
we | had | a hard-fought primary 
they | put | the focus 
we | win | the White House 
November | to defeat | John McCain 
the Republicans | beating back | George Bush 
rallying cries | to close | ranks 
who | was | vice president 
you | believe | it 
We | do n't have to accept | the situation 
We | have | the power 
it | needs to be backing | the Democratic Party 
November | are | them 
It | is | an open question

party leaders | say | a big hurdle 
The headlines | were | all

You | got | a lot of attention 
we | talked | Monday night 
You | were | the first couple of hours 
I | said | I 
everybody | was going to give | tremendous speeches 
this convention | could be | the best 
I | think | I 
It | was | some spectacular speeches 
I | think | Will Rogers 
I | do n't belong | an organized political party 
I | 'm | a Democrat 
I | think | we 
I | think | everybody 
I | think | President Clinton 
Senator Clinton | did | a good job 
I | think | Senator Obama 
I | think | he 
I | think | he 
I | think | he 
I | think | both 
Senator Clinton | have | a real role 
I | think | they 
This | is | Senator Obama's show 
He | is | the nominee 
There | is | nothing 
you | see | the Clintons 
That | would be up | Senator Obama 
I | think | they 
I | think | they 
it | is | a little bit of a 
I | suspect | they 
they | find | out 
they | find | out 
people | find | Sarah Palin 
she | supports teaching | creationism 
she | 's | a person 
that | 's going to be | Democrats 
I | do n't think | it 
I | think | Senator Clinton 
a good job | talking | her voters 
I | think | Senator Obama 
I | think | they 
I | think | they 
we | going to find | some people 
there | is | somebody 
Yakashima | is going to be | a cave 
you | know | what 
we | can always dig | somebody 
I | think | the party 
We | 're going to have | James 
We | are | two hours 
A lot of news | to cover | the political world
