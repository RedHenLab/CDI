WHAT WE'LL CREATE ACROSS AMERICA | IS | > > 
we | will create | America 
they | clashed | again today 
It | was | a historic surge 
the candidates | launching | new promises 
Obama | announcing | a sweeping economic proposal 
McCain | creating | a new campaign plan 
They | will meet | their third and final presidential debate 
the stakes | are | the man 
McCain | came | telling supporters 
he | is | a fighter 
he | had | no new economic ideas 
the McCain campaign | says | they 
I | think | it 
it | raises | the stakes 
this | was | a good theme today 
It | fits | who 
he | is and is | sort of his whole narrative 
it | 's been | sort of a theme 
this campaign | started | the argument 
terrorism | is | a transcendent challenge of our times 
it | became | a campaign 
you | trust | Obama 
I | 'm going to fight | you 
we | will have to see | what 
they | would even have | economic proposals 
I | think | he 
I | think | he 
Senator Obama | had | a 
McCain | needs to match | him 
you | wrote | a blog 
it | is | the McCain campaign 
you | said | James Carville's famous slogan 
it | is | the economy 
what | have | you 
( LAUGHTER ) | > | > COOPER 
McCain | gets | it 
he | does n't get | it 
I | think | Bill Ayers 
that stuff | was | legitimate six 
It | 's | legitimate today 
No one | cares | it 
People | want to know | what 
you | 're going to do | me 
you | understand | my problems 
you | have | some kind of a plan 
we | vote | you 
a theme | get | this economy 
we | do n't have | much confidence 
he | does n't come | an economic plan 
he | does n't basically win | this debate 
he | ca n't tie | this debate 
He | has to win | this debate 
people | to take | a second look 
CNN's Dana Bash | interviewed | McCain earlier today 
us | play | that 
I | 'm | you 
who | has | a much more clear , established relationship 
William Ayers | was | an unrepentant terrorist 
He | is | a person 
he | wanted to set | more bombs 
this | is | a very big question 
I | think | people 
Senator Obama | said | he 
Mr. Ayers | is | an unrepentant terrorist 
that | is | a unique individual 
you | think | it 
McCain | is staying away | Wright 
He | said | he 
he | 's sticking | it 
he | tries to go | it 
they | could use | his own words 
you | attack | the North Carolina Republican Party 
you | use | it 
you | saw | today 
I | have been extolling | Ed 
he | was | a prophet 
he | said | John McCain 
Today's speech | was exactly | what Hillary Clinton 
I | 'm going to fight | you 
I | think | what 
the tail end of the Democratic primary | is going to turn | the same way 
I | am going to fight | you 
he | simply playing | the entire Hillary Clinton campaign 
you | know | what 
She | did n't get | the nomination 
it | might not work | him 
Bill Kristol | said | the campaign staff 
there | are | many , many Republican strategists and camp followers 
who | are | extremely discouraged right 
I | think | Bill Kristol 
He | fired | his campaign 
he | was | trouble 
he | did rise | the ashes 
I | have to tell | you 
you | think | the campaign staff 
I | have disagreed seriously | a lot of what 
it | is | the candidate 
who | is | his campaign staff 
It | 's | the campaign staff 
who | is | the candidate 
The candidate | is | the quality of his campaign 
what Bill Kristol | was saying | today 
Barack Obama | is running | a superior campaign 
We | 're going to | more 
the GOP ticket | crossed | the line 
That | is | what
