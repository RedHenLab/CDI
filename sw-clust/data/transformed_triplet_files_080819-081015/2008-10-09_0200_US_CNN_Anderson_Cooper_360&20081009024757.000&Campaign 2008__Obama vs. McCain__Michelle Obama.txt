This race | has become | about serious differences 
you | think | my husband 
I | think | he 
he | should be | the next president of the United States 
we | 've shown | you 
most major polls | showed | people 
We | heard | the other potential first lady today 
She | sat | Larry King right 
you | react when | people 
Tom Bradley | was | mayor of Los Angeles 
He | ran | governor of California 
The polls | had | him 
I | think | he 
the Bradley factor | has become | people 
I | 'm | a black " 
you | fear | that 
People | talk | it 
it | is | the case of this election 
You | have | a past case 
Barack Obama | is | the Democratic nominee 
there | was going to be | a Bradley Effect 
it | was going to be | play Barack 
We | have to focus | the country 
That | was | several decades 
I | think | there 
there | will be | people 
who | will never vote | Barack Obama 
there | will | people 
who | will never vote | John McCain 
I | think right | people 
what | is | the fate of our country 
I | believe | the issues 
they | go | the voting booths 
Your husband | gave | you 
moderator Tom Brokaw | described | a Zen-like Internet question 
What | do | you 
you | learn | it 
you | get | first crack 
she | could give | you 
I | learn | it 
you | react | that ? > > M. OBAMA 
I | thought | he 
I | started going | my list 
the beauty | is | he 
he | does n't know | it 
I | think | his vice-presidential pick 
Barack | looked | the room 
he | got | somebody 
who | was | an equal , 
who | would be | his partner 
who | would challenge | him 
He | surrounds | himself 
he | knows | what 
It | is | our " Shot of the Day 
this | was | all about 
it | means | you
