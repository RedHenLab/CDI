Republicans | are tossing | him 
his surrogates | use | everything 
I | do n't buy | that 
Ayers | is | a white guy 
what | is | that 
there | is | a kernel of truth 
It | was | The New York Times " 
they | have | the editorial 
they | were | the ones 
who | put | the front-page story 
that | said | Obama 
they | gave | a little credibility 
it | 's hotly contested | this

the more -- most mud | is thrown | the person 
It | does n't surprise | me 
he | 's doing | it 
the Obama campaign | is | blame 
it | comes | this increasing negative campaign 
They | 've run | some pretty downright deceptive ads 
Rush Limbaugh | made | others 
this | is | just kind of the normal run 
you | saying | what 
It | is | the normal run of the campaign 
I | agree | Mary Frances Barry 
we | 're going to see | this

Joe Biden | was | this morning 
I | think | Obama

John McCain | not going | this road 
he | does not want to go | the road 
I | do think | he 
He | did n't explain | home mortgage plan 
It | was | one of the few innovations 
I | think | he 
I | think | he 
who | support | him 
We | 've got to leave | it 
we | 've got to leave | it 
We | 're | time 
We | 'll have | you 
she | thinks | Hillary Clinton 
We | 'll have | that tonight 
the numbers | are working | Obama's favor 
John King | is | the magic map 
You | know | the math 
it | takes | 270 
Barack Obama | to get | the magic number of 270 
That | is | 360
