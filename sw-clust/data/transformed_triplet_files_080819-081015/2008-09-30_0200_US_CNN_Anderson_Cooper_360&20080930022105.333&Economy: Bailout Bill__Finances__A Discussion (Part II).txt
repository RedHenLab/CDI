I | 'm very disappointed | today's vote 
I | 've spoken | them 
I | know | they 
the House | rejected | the $ 700 billion bailout plan 
we | focus | the stock market 
It | is | credit markets 
The question | is | what 
you | should do | home 
what | is | the big picture 
bad | is | the defeat of this bill 
all of us | > | ALI VELSHI 
Let's | take | a look 
No one | has ever seen | negative 777 
the markets | opened | the attacks of 
you | can see | the course of the day 
it | looked like | there 
a minute | left to go | they 
That | means | this market 
all the selling | done | that 
you | could actually make | that 
It | is | the credit markets 
We | keep saying | credit markets 
I | 'm going to tell | you 
this | is | a Wall Street problem 
this | is | all of our problem 
I | can show | you 
that | has | the credit markets 
I | can describe to | you 
you | got | banks 
you | got | major investors 
Money | flows | these places 
the most direct connection | to | you 
It | is | a loan 
that | 's | the only way 
Money | goes | those same banks 
who | is trying to buy | your house 
you | 've sold | your house 
you | 're | contract 
they | ca n't get | financing 
You | 're stuck | that house 
There | is | another way 
this | would affect | you 
major investors | lend | money 
It | is | corporations 
a short term basis | to fund | their day 
That money | could affect | your job 
we | 're not talking | just the biggest of corporations 
people | are saying | look 
we | have n't had | this deal and nothing 
We | 're talking | little businesses 
We | 're talking | people 
who | ca n't make | payroll 
who | may need | $ 10,000 
they | ca n't get | it 
this credit market freeze | is just | Wall Street 
there | is | lots of reasons 
There | is | lots of reasons 
this | is | Main Street 
I | do n't think | a lot of people 
I | do n't want to spend | all this money 
it | 's also bailing | Main Street 
We | lost | $ 1.2 trillion 
who | lost | that money 
who | has | retirement accounts 
they | 've lost | money 
they | have n't lost | it 
they | have n't sold | it 
it | will take | them 
what | has happened | them 
everybody | is trying to figure | out 
we | solve | this problem 
everybody , mom and pops | are watching | their money 
it | is hurting | them 
who | are looking | the market thinking 
you | know | 10 , 20 , 30 years 
it | is | a different story 
they | do n't need to be | people 
that 401( k | ) | money 
it | 's really hitting | them 
not | have | they 
they | 've seen | the price of their homes 
They | see | the fact 
everything | is costing | them 
they | had | a savings account 
they | 're making | that money 
what | is | it 
you | see | Ali 
it | 's hurting | you 
interest rates | are | so low right 
you | ca n't get | an interest 
Nobody | is going to pay | you 
that | affects | our older people 
We | 're going to have | a lot 
which | was linked | all the way 
a picture of I | think | Biden and Palin 
I | 'll try to get | them 
more of her eye | opening | interview 
You | 're watching | us
