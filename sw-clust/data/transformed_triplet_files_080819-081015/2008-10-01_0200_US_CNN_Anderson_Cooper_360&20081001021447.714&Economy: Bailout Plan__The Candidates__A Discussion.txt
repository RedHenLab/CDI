the market | going up | the way 
Any solution | will be | a bipartisan solution 
we | will stay here | the answer 
a Senate bailout package | could come | a vote tomorrow 
you | stare | the abyss 
You | have to wonder | what 
the candidates | are learning | it 
What | do you think | McCain and Obama 
they | 're staring | ? ( LAUGHTER ) 
I | do n't think | either one 
they | have got | different reasons 
they | were | today 
John McCain | swerved | the road 
last week | went | the ditch 
he | paid | a heavy price 
That | is | the perception 
he | knew | he 
He | got back | the road today 
He | had | a 
he | was | much smoother 
I | think | he 
he | 's had | the past two weeks 
he | gets | a bill 
there | is | a bill 
Palin | has | a good interview 
he | can get | his whole 
track | get | some momentum 
I | think | that 
Barack Obama | has been | a little 
Barack Obama | has been | more hands-off 
He | 's coming back | Wednesday night 
he | is going to continue laying | a lot of the problem 
he | did | today 
we | will have | a much bigger attack 
there | is | a bailout bill 
this thing | passes | Congress 
Obama | hammers away | it 
there | is | a bailout bill 
> > | ED | ROLLINS 
I | think | it 
It | 's | the topic of the week 
it | is | today 
I | think | he 
I | agree | David 
He | is | sort 
he | has to make | his ads 
his ads | are tearing | the heck 
I | think | the key thing 
who | wants to look | presidential 
the dirty work | is being done | the ads and 
the ads are | diminishing | capacity 
I | think | there 
he | has to basically make | his case 
Barack Obama | based | Obama's perceived record 
he | is | a liberal 
There | is | a lot of things 
the Democratic Party | is for | a lot of things 
the country | would like | the rhetoric 
which | is | the financial package 
I | think | they 
you | see | their styles 
yesterday | was criticizing | Obama 
others | have criticized | Obama 
calls | to -- | folks 
the House | to try to convince | Democrats 
who | were n't going to vote | this thing 
we | did n't need | more Democrats 
the Republicans | had done | what 
I | think | we 
Barack Obama's | been | the last two weeks 
who | had asked | him 
I | think | folks 
this week | did n't , like , invent | this 
Congress | reacts | the country 
which | was overwhelmingly | this package 
Ali Velshi | had made | the speech 
we | needed | an economic package 
nobody | was really making | the case 
That | is | the president's job 
I | think | that 
Barack Obama | is right | saying 
this | does fall | the president's feet 
there | is | a crisis 
there | is | a crisis 
the Treasury Department | has known | this 
that | is really where | the communication 
we | were just never going to get | sort of the election squabble 
I | think | everybody realized 
today | made | no one 
that | is going to be | John McCain's neck 
he | get away | this 
I | think | the event 
he | can get away | the events of the last two weeks 
the Congress | passes | the bill 
things | get | a little better 
I | think | his problem 
he | has | a twofold problem 
the momentum | has gone | Obama 
He | has got | a four- or five-point lead 
you | look | the polls 
things | are looking better | him 
McCain | has to reverse | the momentum of the race 
he | 's going to face | is 
this bill | is not going to solve | everything 
We | 're going to have | a jobs report 
which | is going to be | the last jobs report 
we | 're going to have | another 100,000 jobs 
you | 're going to have | other economic news 
that | is going to keep | the focus 
that | helps | Obama 
he | gets | it 
he | faces | a much tougher fight 
he | did | a couple of weeks 
It | is | a judgment call 
people | anticipate | this point 
she | can do | the other things 
you | do | a campaign 
I | do n't think | she 
I | think | she 
it | is | a judgment call 
it | is | just one more ding 
I | do n't think | she 
I | think | the format of the debate 
they | have worked | it 
the debate | will be | a character study 
I | do n't think | it 
People | are going to focus right back | the 
personal financial guru Suze Orman | taking | your questions 
it | can be | these days 
We | will tell | you 
she | is getting | Joe Biden 
The answer | may surprise | you 
we | sent | our correspondent 
you | can see | Russia 
Sarah Palin | cites | the closeness 
she | has | foreign policy experience 
the remote island | have | no idea 
Gary Tuchman | has wandered | the island 
You | will meet | some of them
