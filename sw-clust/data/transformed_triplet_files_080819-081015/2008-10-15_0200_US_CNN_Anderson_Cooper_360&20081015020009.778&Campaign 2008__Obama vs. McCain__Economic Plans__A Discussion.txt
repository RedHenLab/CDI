>> | > | global reaction 
investors | weighing | the administration's new plan 
the Nasdaq | plunging | a lot deeper 
We | will have | more 
the economic plan | announced | today 
John McCain | laying | new economic proposals 
Barack Obama | did | the same yesterday 
We | 're now | the eve of the presidential debate 
John McCain | is vowing to fight hard | the end 
the latest CNN poll of polls | showing | Senator Obama 
game-changers | get | each passing day 
that | has crushed | his campaign 
John McCain | rolled | a $ 52.5 billion economic plan 
I | 'm elected | president 
I | will help to create | jobs 
a president | can do | this 
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ) | > | > MCCAIN 
jobs | protect | your life savings 
McCain's new initiatives | would eliminate | taxes 
workers | drawing | unemployment 
individual investors | to write | up to $ 15,000 
we | will also cut | the tax rate 
( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ) | > | > MCCAIN 
them | keep | more of their own savings 
The Democratic ticket | spent | the day double-teaming Ohio and McCain 
he | does n't know much | McCain's latest proposals 
There | is | some ideas 
Senator McCain | has put forward | the last couple of weeks 
that | are | very bad ideas 
It | is | the kind of coolly critical analysis 
Obama | has made | an art form 
Joe Biden | does | the rocking 
One guy | is fighting | you 
( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ) | > | > BIDEN 
the third and final debate | is | his last , best shot 
many of whom | have not been impressed | McCain 
who | founded | a group 
McCain | did not mention | Ayers 
Some conservatives | are urging | him 
It | might hearten | those 
who | think | McCain 
It | may likely turn | independents 
who | seem to be turning | Obama 
we | have been focusing | the last couple days 
you | hear now | the economy 
you | hear | Barack Obama 
today | has been very much | the economy 
Barack Obama | says | he 
he | 's got | a record of tax hikes 
this | is really | a risk 
He | had | a line 
it | is | a 
so many | gone | so little 
you | do n't know | this guy 
he | 's taken | it 
he | does n't use | that word 
it | is | very much 
I | 'm | the fighter 
I | understand | pain 
You | understand | pain 
sort | trying to connect | the audience 
> > | bringing | Bill Ayers 
Senator McCain | guaranteed | it 
he | suggested | it 
who | brings | it 
THE MARK REARDON SHOW" | > | MARK REARDON 
Many of your supporters | are | you 
Hillary Clinton | brought | this up 
Senator Obama | says | you 
the guts | to do | it 
I | was astonished to hear | him 
he | was surprised | me 
the guts | to do | that 
the fact | is | the question 
I | think | he 
it | will come up | this time 
McCain | moving | defense 
what | does | Obama 
who | is also | an Obama supporter 
it | seems | McCain 
he | have to be | careful tomorrow night 
this | is | his last opportunity 
I | think | it 
The New York Times has | a poll 
a growing number of voters | perceive | him 
the attack | offering | specific solutions 
that | 's hurting | him 
they | have | Obama 
there | is | some evidence 
these attacks | are hurting | him 
Senator McCain | did | exactly the right thing 
that | was to give | us 
he | would do | this 
that | was | a good prelude 
It | set | him 
He | put | some proposals 
he | wo n't be throwing | the table 
he | did | the last time 
he | came | that mortgage idea 
that | came | nowhere 
I | think | his problem 
the federal government | is tossing | numbers 
he | comes | a $ 50 billion plan 
Obama | comes | a $ 60 billion plan 
it | does n't sound | very much , 
( LAUGHTER ) | > | > COOPER 
( LAUGHTER ) | > | > COOPER 
the way | to do | it 
I | do n't think | that 
Both of these candidates | have been out | the campaign trail 
This campaign | has been longer | train smoke 
( LAUGHTER ) | > | > CASTELLANOS 
they | have gotten to know | these candidates 
There | is | thousands of ads 
They | have had | these candidates 
you | do n't know | Barack Obama 
there | is | a secret Barack Obama 
I | think | that 
I | think | Senator McCain 
you | do n't know | Barack Obama 
He | said | he 
What | happens | Democrats 
no one | to stop | them 
that | is | voters 
Obama | has not been | his relationship 
it | was | a guy 
He | sat | a board 
I | did n't know | his past 
I | met | him 
I | was | only 8 
he | was setting | bombs 
you | think | he 
this | > | ROLAND MARTIN 
who | are | most vulnerable 
who | do n't have | jobs 
who | ca n't afford | gas 
who | ca n't buy | food 
who | ca n't get | milk 
I | was | Fayetteville State University tonight 
independents | do n't care | this Ayers stuff 
I | was | Fayetteville State University tonight debating Michael Steele 
we | think | it 
it | is | mistake 
People | are caring | pocketbook issues 
you | can throw | all kind of extraneous stuff 
they | want to know how | they 
McCain | sticks | the economy 
I | can be | a leader 
he | scores | more points 
he | is | message 
we | 're talking | the next day 
you | 're giving | Obama 
a shot | to hit | you 
that | is | old politics 
It | is | a bad move 
I | heard | some Democrats 
I | was talking | today 
you | know | what 
you | look | eight years 
Al Gore | led | George W. Bush 
we | have | them 
we | want | them 
he | have | a point 
( LAUGHTER ) | > | > GERGEN 
you | can come from | this way 
Karen Hughes | pointed | "LARRY KING 
Ronald Reagan | was | double digits 
Jimmy Carter | heading | late October 
There | was | one final debate 
There | was | one debate 
He | won | that debate 
the last 10 days | actually got | the majority of the popular vote 
I | think | it 
he | can close | lead 
anything | can happen | Election Day 
I | think | Alex 
an Obama administration | working | Pelosi and Reid 
Obama's | been talking | a $ 150 billion stimulus package 
we | would like to double | that 
we | would like to go | $ 300 billion 
I | do n't know | all this money 
I | do n't know | what kind of deficits 
we | 're rolling | out 
I | think | Alex 
That | is | a more promising line of attack 
who | is saying | what 
you | said | is 
You | get | your people 
Republicans | are doing | the exact same thing 
we | have got | this won 
you | know | what 
We | are going to have | more 
we | 're certainly interested | what 
I | have already logged | myself 
That | is | AC360.com 
The candidates | making | a lot of promises 
they | will do | you 
they | will cost | you
