John McCain | did not vote | John Kerry 
that | 's | the only surprise Meghan McCain 
Her blog | offers up | her personal experience 
It | is | candid 
it | courting | younger Americans 
you | be | the judge 
John McCain | marches | the steps of his campaign plane 
our eyes | are peeled | someone 
who | walks | about a minute 
a 23-year-old | named | Meghan McCain 
Meghan | is | the campaign trail 
I | believe | we 
I | believe | we 
my dad | is | the best candidate 
He | has | the most experience 
I | know | I 
we | share | DNA 
She | 's created | a Web site 
It | does not discuss | policies 
It | 's designed | more 
who | watch | " American Idol 
I | think | there 
it | is | they 
She | travels | the country 
she | stays | the background 
My wonderful daughter Meghan | is here somewhere | the audience 
she | graduated | a degree 
The campaign bus | had been driven | this York , Pennsylvania , hangar 
Meghan | stays | the bus 
she | does | her blogging 
she | reveals | candid thoughts 
She | defends | her dad 
the bus | claiming | her father 
She | acknowledges | she 
there | is | her shoe fascination 
She | shows | her shoes 
Who | does n't want to know | what kind of shoes Dr. Kissinger 
she | makes | this admission 
she | had always been | a registered independent 
she | voted | John Kerry 
she | decided to become | a Republican 
The campaign | says | nobody 
There | is always | a great risk 
you | 're | an underdog 
McCain | is at least | a mild underdog 
you | do have to roll | the dice 
I | suppose | this 
the free-wheeling openness | is not being carried | media 
(voice-over | ) | She 
staff | saying | she 
who | knows | her 
It | does | a little of everything 
both | love | the blog 
she | 's done | such a marvelous job 
Meghan | says | her mom 
a huge fan of the rock group Cream | went | their reunion concert 
You | wo n't learn | any stuff 
I | cannot imagine being | that plane 
This | happened | Germany 
the plane | plowed | lines 
they | used | a cherry picker 
Both | plucked | the aircraft 
you | can see | all the most recent " Shots 
you | can also see | other segments 
you | can get | a better handle
