I | do look forward | Thursday night 
We | 're going to talk | those new ideas 
I | 've never met | him 
I | 've been hearing | his Senate speeches 
kind | taking | a shot 
The two | will meet | Thursday night 
53 percent of voters | have | a favorable opinion of Sarah Palin 
That | is down | four points 
The poll | was conducted | Palin's interview 
the vice-presidential candidate | certainly struggled to answer | some questions 
Palin | says | she 
She | was seated next | John McCain 
she | says | it 
she | said | it 
We | 'll bring | it 
some conservatives | are now calling | the Palin problem 
Sarah Palin | could do | no wrong 
David Brooks | criticized | her 
Brooks | arguing | Palin 
Kathleen Parker | wants | Palin 
she | is | her league 
CBS's Katie Couric interview | asks | Palin 
who | are concerned | the health-care reform 
It | 's got to be | all 
So health care reform | reducing | taxes 
spending | has to got to accompany | tax reduction 
NBC's " Saturday Night Live | > | > TINA FEY 
reform | reducing | taxes 
Republican strategist Bay Buchanan | says | Palin 
She | blames | Palin's handlers 
They | seem to have decided | this 
You | have to say | it 
It | is | a quite clear 
she | 's attempting to give | answers 
that | were given | her 
Palin | appeared | what 
Russia | count | foreign policy experience 
our next-door neighbors | are | foreign countries 
Putin | rears | his head 
It | is | Alaska 
times | seemed | odds 
She | said | she 
it | takes to stop | terrorists 
John McCain | has criticized | such talk 
we | 're not going to do | anything 
she | is | the Republican base 
political expert Larry Sabato | says | the ticket 
It | would be | a disaster 
I | do n't think | the McCain campaign 
They | had hoped | Palin 
Governor Palin | is heading | Senator McCain's ranch 
advisors | referred to | a debate camp 
Today conservative William Kristol | wrote | the only real problem 
Kind of what Bay Buchanan | said | the " New York Times 
McCain | needs to liberate | his running mate 
her | to use | her political talents 
you | said | kind of a similar thing 
they | should let | Palin 
I | think | it 
> > | ED | ROLLINS 
This | is | a smart women 
who | has | extraordinary experience 
They | ought to give | her 
her | read | it 
who | can help | her 
her | go | the gut 
She | 's going to have to answer | about 10 or 12 questions 
herself | is | such a good idea 
You | try | it 
you | basically listen | her answers 
you | basically try and mold | them 
them | be | her answers 
we | 've been | this 
my sense | is | they 
there | is | nobody 
she | knows or feels | confident about 
she | needs | that 
Ed Rollins | is | every point 
Authenticity | is | politics 
you | have | a lot of handlers 
you | 've got | three different golf pros 
that | will give | you 
25 different tips | to hit | a golf ball 
You | ca n't hit | the ball 
I | thought | they 
her | to do | a number of regional press interviews 
which | tends to be | a little 
I | thought | she 
she | 'd have done | a ton of interviews 
Ed Rollins | said | last week 
there | is | a question 
who | may have lost | her self-confidence 
her | kept | her 
they | 're showing | weakness 
the media | have | this kind of conversation 
It | looks | you 
that | is called | repetition 
That | is | what 
It | is | NFL 
you | put | somebody 
who | is | a rookie 
what | do | they 
You | can stay | the sidelines 
you | 're | the field 
you | do n't know how | it 
the question | is thrown | her 
she | might make | a couple of mistakes 
you | put | her 
she | can actually grow | the job 
you | have | a problem 
I | do n't buy | this nonsense 
this | is | a high bar 
She | has to prove | she 
that stage | actually command | respect 
We | 're going to talk | more 
We | 're going to show | you 
She | sat | Katie Couric 
her side | talked | that 
you | saw | a little bit 
It | is | our " Shot of the Day
