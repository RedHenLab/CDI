you | have | an Obama , Pelosi 
the rest of the hooligans | going to run | this country 
we | have got to have | our head 
It | is | time 
two | are representing | us 
we | are | MADDEN 
We | have | the good Reverend Wright 
We | have | Pfleger 
We | have | all of these shady characters 
that | have surrounded | him 
We | have | corruption 
I | am begging | you 
I | am begging | you 
( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ) | > | > COOPER 
what | 's happening | the trail 
former presidential adviser David Gergen | joins | me 
GOP | start | Ed Rollins 
me | start | you 
you | believe | this race 
> > | ED | ROLLINS 
I | 'm | McCain 
I | am going to vote | McCain 
you | ca n't break | the economy 
they | bring up | Reverend Wright 
No one | cares | it 
it | was | a month 
Barack | has met | the threshold 
people | think | he 
He | has tied | McCain 
I | think | people 
It | is | Carter 
David and I | were involved | Reagan 
Reagan | met | the threshold 
people | wanted to get | Carter 
This | is going to turn | a landslide 
What | is | it 
I | think | it 
I | do n't fully agree | Ed 
You | do n't agree | it 
I | think | there 
I | think | that 
That | is | an unknown 
it | 's been | about two weeks 
that | is | very bad news 
he | 's had | a sizable lead 
Gallup tracking | has | it 
That | is | the biggest lead 
we | see | any of the polls 
that | goes | today 
you | do | sense 
McCain | is losing | control 
he | is no longer | the man 
who | seems to be | command 
that | will take | hold 
it | was | just two days 
he | 's not going to talk | Bill Ayers 
He | has put | it 
We | talked | this last night 
he | is today talking | him 
he | talked | Charlie Gibson 
us | listen | what 
He | launched | his political career 
I | do n't care | two washed-up old terrorists 
I | do care | Americans 
he | 's being | it 
there | is | a value 
him | bringing | this up 
I | do n't know | what 
I | do | sense 
Candy | reported | this 
McCain's part | raising | this 
he | was | Charlie Gibson 
I | think | the problem 
McCain | has | is 
voters | are going to process | all the information 
they | 're given | these last 26 days 
they | know | McCain 
that | are | the most adaptive 
I | think | McCain 
He | 's adapting | his base 
all | knew | McCain 
Obama | could make | the argument 
it | is | McCain 
I | think | this back 
David | mentioned | Ayers 
McCain | looked | his crowd 
He | is | a tired guy 
It | is | a long campaign 
He | is | 72 
I | cut | him 
they | 're | both throwing hand grenades 
I | have never seen | a campaign 
they | have done | it 
I | have never seen | two candidates 
Barack Obama | raising | the questions 
what | have | you 
you | want to end | your career 
John McCain | ends | his career 
We | could lose | 10 Senate seats 
We | could lose | 25 House seats 
you | think | 10 
That | is | the biggest number 
There | is | 12 of them 
I | went | the list 
he | needs to help | his party 
He | is | the leader of his party 
he | do | that 
you | have to go give | an alternative 
He | has got to be prepared | this week 
his party | has | a little bit of something 
You | see | that crowd 
they | talk | Ayers 
I | want to give | a positive message 
It | did n't seem | the crowd 
You | do n't give | them 
you | do n't want | the crowd 
he | brings | this party 
his legacy | will be | they 
he | will give | Barack everything 
he | needs to basically move | an agenda 
There | is also | the question of ruling 
It | 's going to be | all the more harder 
whoever | wins | all this anger 
I | think | one of the most striking things 
we | 've seen now | the last few day 
We | 've seen | it 
We | saw | it 
we | saw | it 
There | is | this free floating sort 
that | could really lead | some violence 
I | think | we 
I | think | it 
I | worry when | we 
you | get | the kind of rhetoric 
you | 're getting | these rallies 
I | think | it 
the candidates | try to calm | people 
that | is why | I 
I | think | McCain 
the country | come back | Monday 
He | is | the one 
who | ought to be | buying TV time 
We | 've got | to 
it | is | John McCain 
Obama | has been | a model of cool , calm 
he | 's launched | his attacks 
us | not pretend | this 
We | 're going to have to leave | it 
It | could be | a record turnout 
registration fraud | are popping | around the country
