the Dow Jones industrial | gaining | 400 points 
that | has seen | blue chips 
The American people | can be | we 
our financial markets | improve | investor confidence 
decades | has unleashed | panic 
CNN's Candy Crowley | is | the trail 
the economic crisis | dominated | the fourth straight day of headlines 
John McCain | said | he 
The chairman of the SEC | serves | the appointment of the president 
I | were | president today 
I | would fire | him 
( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ) | > | > CROWLEY 
this | is | sound of McCain 
this | is | the sound of Barack Obama 
who | is going to fight | you 
New polls | indicate | Obama 
The CNN poll of polls | shows | Obama up 
neither candidate | is | a position 
who | would take | control 
Obama scoring McCain | changing | his mind 
He | is | what 
he | thinks | what 
I | have | a message 
You | cannot just run away | the long-held views 
You | ca n't erase | 26 years of support 
who | helped to bring | some of the problems 
you | ca n't just erase | all 
McCain | scoring | Obama 
he | felt | the AIG bailout 
he | did n't know | what 
He | may not realize | it 
you | do n't get to vote | president of the United States 
( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ) | > | > CROWLEY 
It | is | a reference 
the Republican and Democratic ticket | did | some sparring of their own 
It | began | Joe Biden's explanation 
people | making | $ 250,000 
a year | should pay | more taxes 
You | got | it 
It | is | time 
Sarah Palin | took | the cause 
Joe Biden | said | it 
taxes | is | patriotism 
( AUDIENCE BOOING ) | > | > PALIN 
that | is | patriotism 
jobs | hurting | small businesses 
( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ) | > | > CROWLEY 
Barack Obama | has promised | new ideas 
he | meets | his economic advisers 
John McCain | has add | a stop 
It | is | they 
us | dig | Candy Crowley 
either of the candidates | responded | tonight's breaking news 
Barack Obama | is | route 
I | 'm | John McCain 
I | know | he 
this | has fundamentally changed | the race 
Obama | is now rising | the polls 
we | know how much | that 
We | do know | the post-convention honeymoon 
the national polls | did come | a stop 
we | have seen | a slight trickle 
People | are connecting | the dots 
you | 're back | domestic issues 
the character | contrasts | the Republicans 
it | has | something 
they | should be | they 
this | has changed | the campaign 
it | 's hit | the pause button 
This | is now | the big issue 
the campaigns | realize | that 
it | just changing | everyday 
they | did n't have | a strategy 
it | is | sort of classic politics 
Both sides | had dealt | economic issues 
it | was | the foreclosure decision 
that | were completely | whack 
they | have talked | that 
this | is | pretty formulaic right 
you | have | Barack Obama 
John McCain | does n't understand | your problems 
he | is | part of the problem 
He | 's been | Washington 
what | is | John McCain's response 
he | wo n't even step | a limb 
charge of an issue | say how | he 
I | have | maverick credentials 
It | fits | both themes 
Obama | is saying | McCain 
he | does n't talk | being Republican 
That McCain | does not talk | George Bush 
You | bet | it 
that McCain | is trying to move away | the identity of his party 
there | are | some notable exceptions 
it | is | a traditional Republican approach 
McCain | is right | he 
it | was | two years 
he | called | more 
Barack Obama | said | nothing 
McCain | did do | that two years 
most of his career | has been | deregulation 
I | do n't like | Bush's guys 
there | is | a bigger issue 
this | is | a domestic crisis 
is unfolding | seven weeks 
The president | is | very relevant right 
He | happens to be named | George W. Bush 
He | may be | the country 
he | is | very relevant right 
you | saw | the picture 
We | 're going to have | more 
There | is also | news 
investigators | looking | the allegations of abuse 
that | may put | some of the choicest Texas beachfront property off-limits
