We | begin | the breaking news 
We | know | it 
We | know | it 
we | learned | the FBI 
possible mortgage fraud | involving | subprime lenders 
He | is also | the author of Stealing elections 
what | do we know | this investigation 
There | are | now 26 companies 
Twenty-six | > | VELSHI 
they | are looking | these companies 
these companies | know | there 
there | was | fraud 
the FBI | is investigating | this 
there | was | wrongdoing 
we | do n't know | there 
we | do n't know | what 
they | will find | it 
a deal | is | this 
I | think | it 
You | think | there 
I | have written | Fannie Mae 
which | were | government-chartered corporations 
that | made | private profits 
they | had | an implicit government guarantee 
I | have heard over and over again | sources 
Freddie Mac | were covering up | things 
They | were | the public sector Enron 
Enron | went | business 
we | learned | Fannie Mae 
Freddie Mac | were cooking | their accounting books 
they | kept making | more mortgages 
this | is | a question 
this | is | private companies 
these quasi-public companies | engaging | the financial scandal of the century 
whose sole job | was to oversee | Fannie Mae 
Freddie Mac | > | FUND 
They | distributed | campaign contributions 
you | were | a Washington 
you | were | a charity 
you | got | a donation 
They | were | a great corporate citizens 
they | were | a bizarre form of corporate citizen 
They | made | private profits 
They | paid | huge private sector salaries 
the risk | went | the taxpayer 
people | want | more investigation 
They | can go | parallel tracks 
The FBI | can continue to investigate | that 
that | does not affect | the fact 
this package | needs to move ahead | some form 
I | think | the average person 
we | 're debating | this 
this country | is coming | a halt 
It | is | impossible 
companies | to get | money 
they | need | it 
you | know where | this 
It | 's just more | expensive home loans 
It | is | the fact 
there | are | some companies 
that | borrow | money 
there | could be | major corporations 
that | have to grind | a halt 
they | ca n't raise | money 
We | had | a preview of this 20 years 
the government | raised | the loan guarantees 
The savings and loans | then invested | windmills 
they | were | bull semen farms 
That | is why | this current resolution trust corporation 
we | set | the savings and loan 
this | is much bigger | scope 
it | 's freezing | the credit markets 
this | will take | a couple of years 
people | will go | prison 
You | think | there 
no doubt people | will go | prison 
I | can almost guarantee | it 
people | involved | these companies 
we | know | people 
they | were covering | the extent 
they | were taking | undue risks 
We | know | members of Congress 
nobody | touched | Fannie Mae 
there | was | proper oversight 
We | know | some people 
Freddie Mac | expanding | the mortgage pay pie 
everybody | could make | money 
What | are | the chances 
the FBI | might investigate | members of Congress 
this | > | FUND 
I | think | it 
I | will pinpoint | the day 
which | thought | this 
they | were going to introduce | something 
This | was | a mistake 
who | ca n't afford | even one penny 
a down payment | might not be | a mortgage 
A lot of people | got | loans 
we | 're going to talk | you
