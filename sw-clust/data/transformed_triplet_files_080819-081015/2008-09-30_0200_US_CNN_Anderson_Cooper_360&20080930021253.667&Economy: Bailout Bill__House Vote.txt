They | claim to be | free market advocates 
it | is really | an anything 
you | will have | a golden parachute 
the taxpayer | will bail | you 
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi | making | that very partisan speech 
the Republicans side | says | that 
they | failed to get | the votes 
they | would need to pass | the bailout 
what | happened | today 
It | is | pure partisan politics 
both sides | whining | who 
You | might think | they 
a lot of lawmakers | headed | home 
The economy | is sliding | abyss 
they | 're | all worried 
We | 're digging | deeper tonight 
the President and Congressional leaders | insisted | this bill 
this | is | a huge failure of leadership 
The House members | house | Democrats 
who | voted | this 
it | is really | the house of Republicans 
I | think | bear 
Two-thirds | voted | it 
it | was | a Republican president 
who | supported | this 
who | pushed | it 
it | was | House conservative Republican members 
who | derailed | it 
they | have | strong reasons 
they | voted | it 
we | pay | a huge price 
we | paid | today 
we | continue to pay | a huge price 
you | said | equity value 
it | may get | worse tomorrow 
it | was | the house Republicans 
who | derailed | this 
They | were | it 
They | made | that clear 
Nancy Pelosi | making | a speech 
she | should n't have said that and yes | that 
they | changed | their minds 
she | has | a few words 
them | run back | their partisan corners 
neither one of the presidential candidates | has actually shown | much star power 
I | mean | neither John McCain 
they | ought to pitch | now and everybody 
this | was | one of the worse mistakes 
I | have ever seen | Congress 
You | assume | the crunch 
people | will do | what's right 
I | have seen | this 
me | get | you 
I | want | you 
the Democrats | did n't come | enough votes 
> > | ED | ROLLINS 
it | is | a failure of leadership 
It | starts right | the President 
the President | is | such a weakened position 
he | did n't stage | this thing 
I | mean running out | the Oval Office everyday 
I | have done | the past 
this | should have been | a state of the union type speech 
he | laid | his reasons 
he | got | the gravitas 
They | did not explain | this 
what's happened | is | the Congress 
the Republicans | have taken | their constituency 
you | go | a vote 
you | have | the votes 
I | have done | vote counts 
you | say give | me 
I | need | them 
I | want | the names 
I | want to check | them 
Pelosi | had to give | Boehner back 
they | have | 218 
you | buy | this thing 
Pelosi's speech | causing | people 
I | think | it 
stupid speech | to make when | you 
House Republicans | is | there 
you | ca n't put | two Republicans 
you | have | all the Democratic leadership 
there | get | the message 
they | gotten | more votes 
this | is where | blame 
you | start measuring | a score card 
Who | delivered | what 
Democrats | delivered | two 
that | is | the American people 
I | have discussed | this 
I | have literally had | five people 
you | were | a member of Congress 
you | 're getting | 30 , 40 , 50-1 
people | do n't like | it 
they | do n't know | what 
you | have | the Treasury Secretary 
what | does | that mean 
the president | has | no credibility 
you | heard | weapons of mass destruction 
you | do n't level | the American people 
they | ca n't buy | it 
that | is why | they 
people | doing | what's best 
You | get | the sense 
that | did not happen | today 
there | is | no real plan 
I | guess | they 
there | is | no real road map 
what | 's going to happen | the next couple of days 
how | are | we 
It | seems | the height of irresponsibility 
I | agree | that 
It | is | the Jewish members 
whole | delegations take | many of whom 
you | could have still put | this vote 
I | think | what's important tomorrow 
the Treasury Secretary | to try to help maintain | we 
We | do n't have | total runs 
they | got to lay | a road map 
they | plan to put | this 
they | going to pass | sweeteners 
They | 've only got to flip | 12 votes 
I | have to stop | you 
We | got to take | a short break 
We | 're going to have | more form 
Suze Orman | joins | me 
Ali Velshi | to try to break | your options 
what | happens | the people 
who | cannot get | their act 
she | 's saying now | her early remark 
the public | correct | her 
polling data | showing | a shift 
voters | see | her 
that | is ahead | " 360
