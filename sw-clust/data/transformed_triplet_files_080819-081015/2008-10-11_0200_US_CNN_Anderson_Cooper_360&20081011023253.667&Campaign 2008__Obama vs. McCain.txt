We | 're | the underdogs 
we | have | every time 
the pundits | written | the McCain campaign 
We | 're going to fool | them 
We | 're going fool | them 
Candy Crowley | is | the Trail 
aggressive ads | questioning | his ties 
Hostile McCain voters | saying | they 
Barack Obama | can work | that 
They | can run misleading | ads 
they | can pursue | the politics of anything 
John McCain | is | a one-sided war of words 
Obama's strategists | see | no sign 
Obama's character | has gotten | any traction 
it | throw | it 
Nothing's easier | riling | a crowd 
that | 's | what 
we | need right now | the United States 
The Obama campaign | thinks | McCain's attacks 
I | know | my opponent 
that | 's | what 
I | 'm thinking | Americans 
who | are losing | jobs and homes 
one Obama advisor | put | it 
the conventional wisdom | is | negativity works 
this | is | a conventional time 
This | is also | a political time 
Obama | is | a steady as 
He | is widening | his lead 
enough money | to buy | his own show 
John McCain | has to do | something 
Barack Obama | needs run | the clock 
what | 's happening | the trail 
John McCain today | getting booed when | he 
We | 'll talk | the rhetoric 
we | name | another name 
We | think | you 
these people | are and | how much 
they | have | cost
