Asian markets | continuing | what Wall Street

Bill Ayers | comes up frequently | the stump 
it | did not come up | Tuesday's debate 
That | is | something Charlie Gibson of ABC News 
I | 'm | we 
the-top attacks | coming | the McCain campaign 
It | is | a continuing theme 
You | ca n't afford | that kind of erratic , uncertain leadership 
( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ) | > | > OBAMA 
We | need | a steady hand 
( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ) | > | > OBAMA 
We | need | a president 
we | can trust | times of crisis 
Barack Obama | is aiming directly | one of John McCain's enduring strengths 
he | ripped | his evolving plan 
he | has ended | a plan 
that | punishes | taxpayer 
this | is | the kind of erratic behavior 
we | have been seeing out | Senator McCain 
Obama | pounded | McCain 
Joe Biden | worked | his way 
You | 're seeing | John McCain's campaign 
who | is lurching | one position 
this | is | a steady hand 
This | is | a cautious campaign 
the money | to buy | it 
The campaign | announced | today 
it | is negotiating | the broadcast networks 
It | is | a multimillion-dollar endeavor 
the airwaves | will be controlled | Barack Obama 
you | 're saying | it 
they | 're | front 
who | are | this 
they | do n't see | any evidence 
it | is getting | any traction 
They | believe | they 
you | know | what 
John McCain | is talking | this 
he | does n't want to talk | the issues 
he | is | the issue 
he | is | George Bush 
they | have | this 
sort | going | him 
he | goes | the issues 
He | is | this 
He | is | that 
they | do n't see | anything 
they | 're not particularly worried | that 
I | have to tell | you 
you | sort | worry 
they | want to do here | the Obama campaign 
There | are | teleprompters 
there | is | less 
there | will be | a mistake 
There | are | fewer interactions 
This | is | pretty standard stuff 
the voters | get | them 
You | do n't want to make | new policy people 
John McCain | made | some new comments 
We | will show | you 
Sarah Palin | is just | another V.P. candidate 
she | is | a political rock star 
what | is | it 
that | has connected | some women

who | is to blame | the financial meltdown 
We | add | another name
