People | should n't make | a decision 
I | like | that guy 
I | 'm talking | me 
today | talking | a woman's round table 
Mrs. Obama | did n't talk | Sarah Palin 
which | focused | issues 
we | focus | what 
you | thought | John McCain's ads 
a new report | finds | that Obama 
360's Joe Johns | has | the " Raw Politics 
you | thought | John McCain 
that | is | the real Obama 
He | is | the biggest celebrity 
Obama | put | more money 
McCain | explains away | the wage gap 
women | need | more education and training 
The nonpartisan University of Wisconsin Advertising Project | discovered | sudden blip 
WISCONSIN | ADVERTISING | PROJECT 
you | 're talking | the other candidate 
it | is | a negative ad 
Both candidates | spent | about $ 8 million 
56 percent of the McCain ads | mentioned | Obama 
three-fourths of Obama's ads | mentioned | McCain 
Things | have changed | the last 26 years 
It | is | only a snapshot of one week 
it | tells | you 
The study | did n't count | ads 
both campaigns | got when | they 
that | got | a bunch of runs 
these candidates | going | each other 
We | know | lots of studies 
The Obama campaign | argues | it 
their guy | was getting slimed | the convention 
What | 's happened | John McCain 
He | 's running | the sleaziest ads 
one | side | it 
that | make | it 
the other side | to respond | kind 
Republican Congressman Chris Shays | is | one of the architects 
the last big and bipartisan law | to clean | campaign financing 
he | says | one man's response 
a candidate | attacks | the other candidate 
they | are | the candidate 
you | 're looking | both candidates 
this | is | rough stuff 
we | heard | Obama 
that | explain | the change 
the mix | > | CANDY CROWLEY 
polls | change | a wide variety of reasons 
It | is never | just one thing 
I | think | you 
he | is hitting | him 
The economy | has come back | the headlines 
we | 're moving further and further away | the convention 
which | gave | John McCain 
there | have been | more and more stories 
I | think | you 
that | is | what 
you | 're looking | the polls 
we | heard | a lot of Democrats 
Obama | to show | more fire 
the criticism | was | more Obama 
They | want to see | him 
John McCain | do | it 
that | makes | a personal connection 
Democrats | do | the Obama ad 
he | looks directly | the camera 
my Web site | read | my plan 
That | is | an ad Bill Clinton 
he | was | the ropes 
You're | going to hear | a lot of stuff 
it | is | me 
I | have | plan 
I | can actually help | you 
it | was | Barack Obama 
who | ran | the first negative ad 
They | have created | this image of new and different 
they | play | bare-knuckle politics 
there | have been | several people 
that | have looked | this ad 
people | said | Rush Limbaugh 
that | is | what 
Rush Limbaugh | was | a big fan 
Rush Limbaugh | was | a big fan of John McCain 
it | is | me 
I | guess | all campaigns 
the economy | has just completely shifted | the dynamics of this race 
it | evolving how | it 
I | guess | the conventional wisdom 
Obama's | done | a better job capturing 
we | know how | it 
we | have | our travels 
we | see | the little trickle 
little trickle | is | Obama 
It | is | a much better question 
we | 're also entering | the most fascinating part of any campaign 
Both campaigns | have | enough resources 
Obama | has | more 
my lifetime | have | the Democrats 
we | will see | big national cable 
We | will see | the speeches 
this | is when | you 
different parts of the state | giving | very different messages 
we | focus | TV ads 
what | happens | mailboxes 
That | is | some of the toughest stuff 
some | would say | the most nasty stuff 
this | is | something 
you | begin to have | a much better sense of two weeks out 
who | 's knocking | the doors 
many people | are knocking | the doors 
the Democrats | are getting | some high-level help 
Barack Obama | has proven | the stump 
who | are | first-time voters 
who | are | people 
that | have been discouraged | voters 
you | look | it 
you | are looking | an on-the-ground operation 
that | is certainly | what 
I | have not seen that | the Republican side 
that | is where | the difference 
you | can get out | the ground 
We | 're going to have to leave | it
