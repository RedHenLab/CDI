My opponent | has invited | serious questioning 
I | have questioned | his policies 
he | 's called | me 
the McCain camp | finds | itself 
it | 's going | the offensive 
That | is | one way 
they | 're doing | it 
Senator McCain | used | some very strong language 
who | is | the real Barack Obama 
Obama's commercials | have called | McCain 
there | is | strong language 
it | comes | some risks 
It | is almost | we 
the proverbial 401( k ) | turning | a 201(k ) 
we | 've got | this other universe 
the candidates | wondering | historical roads 
They | seem | most Americans 
Barack Obama | was associating | 15 or 20 years 
Most Americans | care deeply | what 
these candidates | are going to do | the next 20 months 
they | 're not hearing | that 
they | 're going to penalize | who 
these personal things of the past | does not respond to and | present a plan 
you | 're still talking | the past 
he | 's talking | the war 
we | got | the war 
the past of Bill Ayers | seems | fair game 
that | is probably | the last card 
That Clinton | did | ? 
you | trust | him 
I | agree | David 
I | do think | this 
Only 12 percent of the country | thinks | we 
you | risk getting | them 
they | 're not talking | what 
you | care | about 
which | is | your pocketbook 
I | think | it 
I | guess | the McCain campaign 
we | are talking | the economy 
It | is just | the media 
we | say | about 
John McCain's own advisors | will tell | you 
certainly other Republicans | will tell | you 
the campaign | has been | all 
They | 've gone back and forth | themselves 
Hillary Clinton | tried to do | Barack Obama something 
the Republicans | have tried to do | every left-of-center Democrat 
they | 're | you 
That | is | what 
they | 're trying to sell | small-town America 
the polls | are breaking | him 
I | 'm standing tonight | Ohio 
Our own polling | shows | Barack Obama 
There | is | a new " Washington Post 
No Republican | has ever won | the White House 
they | 're trying to push | Obama 
It | is | all part of a puzzle 
They | need raise | more doubts 
voters | have | more doubts 
that | is | the economy 
you | were giving | advice 
they | seem to have gone | a complete opposite direction 
they | need to present | an economic plan 
that | is | both candidates 
this particular case | are | senators 
you | could lead | an effort 
they | would do | president 
they | might do | the next three months 
you | opened | this show 
the next three weeks | are | the credits 
the things | feeding | each other 
me | make | one other point 
It | is | the media 
that | is smothering | their effort 
The McCain campaign | said clearly | a conference call 
we | want to turn | the page 
Obama | palling | a former terrorist 
there | is | no 
there | is | no disguise 
They | want to change | the subject 
he | is | danger 
This | could boomerang | both of them 
who | gets | blame 
guys | think | it 
this kind of mud slinging | happens | some time 
It | seems | me 
I | think | that 
what | makes | it 
We | 'll have | more
