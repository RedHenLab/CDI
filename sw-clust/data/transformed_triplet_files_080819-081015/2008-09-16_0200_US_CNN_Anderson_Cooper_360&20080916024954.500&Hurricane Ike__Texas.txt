This | is | Highway 87 
that | may have been | the hardest hit town 
who | was killed | this hurricane 
we | had to take | a boat 
we | 're seeing | this town 
This | is | a house 
This | is | the major intersection 
This | was underwater | 36 hours 
this | is | what 
anyone | was | this house 
we | 've gone | it 
no one | was | this house 
there | is | no way 
there | are | scores of homes 
that | are sitting | the middle of streets 
There | are | lots 
you | do n't see | anything 
This | gives | you 
This | is | the grill 
It | is | a restaurant 
this | is | a very big tourist town 
this | is | what 
we | see | the entire town 
This storm | was | a Category 
there | were | some people 
who | were here | who 
they | say | they 
it | was | a Category 
What | did | you 
What | were | you 
you | were riding | this out 
Just | hope | one of them 
That | is | what 
This | is | the biggest grocery store 
It | 's appropriately called | the Big Store 
we | do n't usually report | rumors 
this rumor | was | we 
Police departments | got | many calls 
the storm | out | this grocery store 
there | are | reports 
we | 're | searchers 
We | 've gone all | it 
there | is | no way 
us | to check | every nook and cranny 
We | can see | no signs 
who | rode | the storm 
There | are | roughly 100,000 year-round residents 
who | live here | Crystal Beach 
there | are | between 20 and 30,000 tourists 
this | is | a much different place 
This | will take | a long time 
The fact | is | there 
we | have seen | this entire town 
It | looks | Waveland 
I | know | some three million customers 
Ike | hit | all 
many | are still | power 
every customer | is | power 
There | is | no power 
There | is | no water 
There | is | no telephone communication 
There | is | no medical care 
who's evacuated | is being told | you 
They | 've actually closed | the bridge 
they | say | you 
it | will be at least | a month 
we | wo n't have | power 
it | is | very symbolic today 
We | took | that boat ride 
It | is | a 40- minute boat ride 
We | had to keep zigging and zagging | there 
There | is | wood 
there | is | metal 
there | is | parts of houses 
there | is | children's toys 
there | is | swimming pools 
there | is | lamps 
there | is | desks 
we | saw | livestock 
We | saw | three cattle
