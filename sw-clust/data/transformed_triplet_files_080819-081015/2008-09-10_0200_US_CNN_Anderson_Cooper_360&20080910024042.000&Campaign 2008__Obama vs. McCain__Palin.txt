I | have | a message 
you | 've sought to make | America 
I | pledge | you 
you | will have | a friend and advocate 
we | want to set | the record 
she | banned | books 
she | cut funding | special-needs kids 
we | heard | rumors 
there | were | a lot of them 
We | 're doing | the same tonight 
which | brought | you 
Barack Obama | is | a Muslim 
it | is | Sarah Palin 
who | 's getting misrepresented | bogus quotes and facts 
one quote | attributed | Palin 
we | found posted | readers 
God | made | dinosaurs 
It | is | a pure fabrication 
Palin | said | it 
It | was totally made | a guy 
who | put | it 
we | know | that 
My name | is | Bob Salsbury 
I | 'm | a blogger 
We | talked | Bob 
he | admits | it 
I | made | all of them 
it | figured | my usual 20 or so regular readers 
I | had | no idea 
there | is | plenty more 
Palin | was | she 
The truth | is exactly | the opposite 
It | has gone | $ 24,000 
which | would be | this year's amount 
it | 's going to increase | $ 74,000 
there | is | the rumor 
Palin | demanded | certain books 
The truth | is | she 
what | was | she 
? | > | NOVAK 
You | could draw | an inference 
Many people | have drawn | an inference 
we | have | no evidence one way 
there | is | an Internet claim 
Palin | said | students 
she | did not make teaching | creationism part of the official curriculum 
you | 're seeing | a trend 
they | 're trying to portray | her as 
which | made | us 
this kind of thing | helps or hurts | the candidate 
that | are | that message 
who | have | a bad impression of her 
she | is | the Republican ticket 
most likely | to buy | this stuff 
it | is | Sarah Palin's turn 
(voice-over ) | Suggesting | she's 
who | scale | the heights of politics
