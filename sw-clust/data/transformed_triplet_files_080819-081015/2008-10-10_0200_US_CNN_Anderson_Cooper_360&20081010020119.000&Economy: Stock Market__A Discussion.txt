We | have got | a lot of politics 
this | is | we 
it | is | us 
this | is | what 
today | looked | Wall Street 
the Dow industrials | plunging | 679 points 
it | was | just a year 
it | hit | an all-time high 
That | is | the lowest since 
President Bush | speaking | today 
we | will show | you 
the breaking news | is | Ali Velshi 
there | was | this massive sell-off today 
we | hit | the bottom 
me | show | you 
This | is | an unprecedented situation 
We | started | this morning 
we | 're looking | a year 
It | was | 14000 
We | were down | the even line 
it | is | a pattern 
it | goes down | 8579 
You | know | what 
your portfolio | might | a little look 
the Dow | started | the 
today | was | the highest 
It | was | 14000 
it | is | more than 35 percent 
Thirty-nine percent | is where | we 
you | look | your 401(k ) 
you | 're | 39 percent 
it | looks | the rest of the market 
there | are | a lot of people 
who | say | that level 
we | 're looking | the bottom 
There | are | some people 
who | say | it 
there | are | folks 
who | are saying | the companies 
that | comprise | these stock markets 
they | 're starting to look | they 
I | guess | the question 
the White House | confirmed | today 
What | does | that mean 
we | have been seeing | the government 
We | saw | AIG 
This | is | part of the $ 700 billion bailout program 
the federal government | giving | money 
it | would n't be | a loan 
they | would get | exchange 
they | would get | stock 
that | goes | the banks 
banking | is | a very profitable business 
that | means | the stock 
We | 're probably | some weeks 
Treasury | has just confirmed | they 
there | is | one piece of good news 
that | is pretty much | it 
There | have been | new layoffs 
One market watcher today | said | she 
it | 's going to be | a long time 
what | can | any of us 
us | bring | Ali 
the wall | bring | in 
people | change | their spending habits 
this point | > | LYNNETTE KHALFANI-COX 
This | is | no time 
you | 're | it 
that | is | what 
I | do n't encourage , to change solely based | the volatility 
you | pull | your money 
you | are going to be hurting | yourself 
you | 're | it 
you | 're just guaranteeing | your losses 
You | 're locking | what 
It | 's | a loss 
you | sell | it 
I | know | it 
people | to see | those statements 
the 35 to 40 percent | declines | a lot of people 
you | 're | 30 , 40 years 
you | can ride | some of this out 
you | 're investing | retirement 
you | have got | 20-plus years 
those losses | are | paper 
you | are locking | those losses 
They | 're | real losses 
you | have to make | all 
History | has shown | us 
They | start to come | the end of a recent 
That | is | people 
It | does n't mean | we 
We | know | the rest of economy 
we | do see | markets 
It | is | a very 
we | think | there 
you | will have locked | your losses 
you | 're not going to get | the gains 
every day | looking | your 
You | know | what 
none of us | has | a crystal ball 
we | do know | past trends 
it | is actually | a very brief period of time 
you | look | the number of days 
the stock market | has gone | a huge upswing 
it | is | something 
What | scares | me 
you | hear | folks 
this | is | a 50-, 100-year event 
I | 'm | they 
us | get | some of these questions 
financially responsible people | benefit | this bailout 
the Dow | is | 35 percent 
a chance | to make | money 
I | think | there 
an opportunity | to make | money 
One | is | you 
you | 're | a strong cash position 
you | might do | some peer-to-peer lending 
We | have heard | a number of these lending sites 
you | 're | a strong position 
you | are going to be | a patient 
you | can go | bargain hunting 
You | can get | some value-oriented stocks 
this | is | a question 
people | are losing | money 
What | is | the answer 
it | is | a deal 
It | is | kind of like 
you | bought | something 
you | bought | a watch 
you | sold | it 
That money | went | the first person 
you | gave | it 
It | is | the same things 
That money | went | wherever 
you | gave | it 
you | can make | more of it 
You | bought | a stock 
you | have to sell | it 
you | bought | it 
it | 's | disappearing 
That | is why | Lynnette 
it | is | a paper loss 
you | lock | it 
We | 're going to have to leave | it 
We | would love to have | you 
What | do you think | the crisis 
I | 'm blogging | the hour 
what | 's going to surprise | you 
it | 's | the economy 
It | is | the socialists 
( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ) | > | > COOPER 
Who | 's to blame | the financial meltdown 
we | are naming | names 
we | add | a second name 
we | 're adding | tonight
