It | is | a national election 
it | is | the battle ground contest 
that | will decide | the winner 
we | move | closer 
us | take | a look 
those | do or die | showdowns 
We | 're going to bring | Joe Klein 
us | take | a look 
it | 's changed | the last month 
we | were just talking | Democrats 
I | want to show | some states 
you | look | polling 
the Obama campaign | thought | it 
new polls | moving | John McCain's favor 
McCain's standing | has improved | Ohio 
It | has improved | out 
It | has improved | out 
Obama | is still | way 
John McCain | closing | the gap 
the Democrats | will now have to put | more time 
us | stop there | a minute 
us | bring | Joe and Bill 
me | ask | you 
you | look | all these polls 
there one factor | driving | the numbers 
I | would say | it 
He | 's | Bill Clinton 
He | is ahead | the economy 
most states | show | him 
This | ought to be | his natural issue 
a better job | handling | the economy 
people | want | change 
They | look | him 
They | find | him 
how much | does he understand | my life 
I | thought ahead | all these states 
the polls | have tightened | his favor 
it | 's happening | all these places 
He | 's going | a national dead heat 
many Democrats | think | he 
Barack Obama's convention | is | uncharted territory 
he | gives | a bang-up speech 
he | 's not going to have | much time 
the conversation | is going to be divided | his speech 
we | 're doing now | his vice presidency 
only it | 's going to be | McCain's vice presidency 
the schedule | does n't work | his favor 
I | continue to think | all of these trends 
this election | will be decided | the debates 
the two of them | are standing up next | each other and 
John McCain | cracks | a joke 
us | follow right | that very point 
I | want to go back | the map 
I | sat | with Democratic pollster Peter Hart 
He | 's been | a lot of these races 
He | suggested watching | two places 
I | want to highlight | them 
One | is here | southeast Ohio 
This light blue | is back | the primaries 
Hillary Clinton | won | this area 
He | says | this 
that | voted | Jimmy Carter 
Those | are | the two Democrats 
the Democrats | have won | the White House 
They | did n't get | the White House 
That | is | one area 
Peter Hart | said | watch 
That | is | small-town rural America 
he | said to watch | is 
he | suggested especially | the state of Missouri 
he | said | conservative suburbs 
you | 're looking | those two demographics 
a better job | managing | the Hillary Clinton relationship 
It | tells | me 
that | would really close | ranks 
It | would appeal | the women voters 
she | did | those Appalachian areas of the country 
Those | are precisely | the constituencies 
she | appealed | to 
he | 's having | trouble 
We | need to leave | it 
I | want to thank | Bill Schneider 
I | want to thank | Joe Klein
