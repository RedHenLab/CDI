Wall Street | worsening | the campaign

Stocks | again taking | a beating 
The Dow | plunging | another 450 points 
Investors | losing | an estimated $ 700 billion today 
The massive federal bailout of AIG not | stemming | the worry 
new developments | could trigger | another tidal wave tomorrow 
what | happened | today 
What | is going to happen | tomorrow 
we | were talking | this 24 hours 
We | thought | this government bailout 
the U.S. government | stepped in | this massive company 
It | did not have | that effect 
It | seemed to worry | the markets 
It | seems to worry | markets 
We | ended | losing 449 points 
That | is | the second biggest loss of the year 
That | is | more than 4 percent 
these | are | big , big numbers

Wachovia | might take | over Morgan Stanley 
We | know | Washington Mutual 
itself | to be taken | over 
last night | was | AIG. 
you | have to go | the government 
it | is going to be | your company 
people | are trying to figure out | they 
they | muddle | the next several months 
you | do n't have | money

we | are seeing | the stock market 
who | do n't follow | this as 
I | 'm wondering | it 
Everyone | is wondering | it 
What | do you do | your stocks 
What | do you do | your 401(k ) 
What | does | all this mean 
home | > | VELSHI 
We | are hoping | we 
we | are closer | the bottom 
You | think | this 
I | think | we 
There | is | no benefit 
this | is how | bad things 
the market | will find | it 
I | think | what 
this | is | what 
we | need to get | the next year 
we | do n't have | this kind of money 
we | have got to raise | it 
There | is | money 
The money | is | China 
you | might see | those companies 
U.S. markets | may open positively | tomorrow morning 
That | is | what 
we | are still | 12 hours 
We | 're going to talk | a lot 
It | is pretty much | all the candidates 
each candidate | running | new ads 
Obama | directing | viewers

us | get | the numbers 
That | is | a seven-point gain 
he | was | 44-46 
He | 's also pulling ahead | our poll of polls 
which | is | a survey of a number 
Sarah Palin | seems to be losing | some of her initial appeal 
CBS poll | showing | her favorable numbers 
It | is now | 40 percent 
she | was offered | the job 
what | to think | her 
The polling | shows | a small Obama lead 
That | is up | a 19-point deficit 
We | have | reports 
Barack Obama | is shuttling | his wish-list states 
a wave of bad economic news | to define | the November stakes 
We | ca n't steer | ourselves 
this crisis | taking | the same disastrous road 
that | is | what 
Obama's strategists | are going | this 
He | uses | the teleprompter 
bite-friendly body slams | to bruise | McCain's maverick image 
This | is | somebody 
who | has been | Congress 
LAUGHTER ) | > | > OBAMA 
who | put | seven of the most powerful Washington lobbyists 
he | tells | us

who | is going to take | the old boys 
LAUGHTER ) | > | > OBAMA

( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ) | > | > CROWLEY 
There | was | no mention of McCain 
a living room | setting talking | mainstream problems and solutions 
OBAMA CAMPAIGN AD | > | > OBAMA 
I | 'm | Barack Obama 
I | hope | you 
I | approve | this message 
the right | wo n't solve | the problems 
we | face | today 
he | 's only running even | a political environment 
Obama | is calling | reinforcements 
poll numbers | showing | a small post-Palin increase 
Joe Biden | posted | a video conversation 
they | say | Obama 
Women | are often bearing | the brunt of the economic changes 
This | is | Obama's shot 
It | may be | several days 
there | is | any tangible proof 
he | has found | his footing 
they | say | he 
It | 's been | a great political week 
We | won | every day 
It | is | it 
what | do | the Obama campaign people 
you | talk to say | those Democrats 
who | are worried | he 
They | may not put | it 
Obama | has told | people 
they | thought | this 
they | are not looking | those national polls 
they | do n't believe | they 
we | have | several battleground state polls 
it | is | neck-and-neck 
they | contend | they 
they | see | a path 
they | think | their path 
they | can pick | Western states 
the fact | is | they 
this | is | those battleground states 
They | want | people 
they | have | the economy 
You | say | they 
a given Obama speech | is focused | the economy 
he | did top | it 
it | is | proof 
it | is | a dangerous world 
that | died | that bombing 
I | want to talk | the economy 
it | includes | things 
he | would do | education 
all | fits | the broad umbrella of the economy 
We | are also going to talk | that bombing 
We | 're going to have | Peter Bergen 
we | 're going to show | you 
she | took | questions 
CNN's Dana Bash | is | the trail 
He | was wrapping | his answer 
the first voter question | confronting | radical Islamic terrorism 
I | know | a great deal 
it | 's not going to be | a short struggle 
( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ) | > | > MCCAIN 
I | want to add | something 
( APPLAUSE ) | > | > PALIN 
my running mate | is | a bit 
We | need to remember | who 
it | was | who 
that | is working | Iraq 
Sarah Palin | playing | character witness 
her first town hall meeting | was | as much 
McCain | carefully deferred | Palin 
he | wants | her 
We | have | hundreds of trillions 
It | is | a matter of Congress 
women | begins | economic empowerment 
( APPLAUSE ) | > | > UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE 
you | give | us

( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ) | > | > PALIN 
this opportunity | to show | that 
people | had asked | the question

( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ) | > | > UNIDENTIFIED MALE 
( LAUGHTER ) | > | > BASH 
The audience | was | nothing 
you | could please respond | that criticism 
you | think | you 
you | want | specifics 
you | can ask | me 
You | can even play stump | the candidate 
that | did n't happen | this town hall 
We | did n't hear | any of the specifics 
McCain | stepped in | he 
she | negotiated | oil companies 
she | commands | the Alaska National Guard 
controlled | are | they 
I | think | people 
who | support | Sarah Palin 
she | did | a fantastic job 
she | got | softballs 
controlled | is | the crowd 
Sarah Palin | wanted to hear | John McCain 
there | was limited | space 
he | got | she 
there | is | no indication 
they | knew | anything 
I | will tell | you 
I | have seen | John McCain 
I | have seen | him 
who | want | real answers 
they | disagree agree | him 
I | will be blogging | the hour
