we | did | last night 
Barack Obama | has also not voted | the Senate 
I | think | he 
he | is | the third 
the Democrats | accusing | McCain 
Those talks | have just ended | Capitol Hill 
we | have been reporting | this hour 
they | 're going to resume | tomorrow morning 
Senator John McCain and Obama | will stay | Washington 
Obama | still planning to be | Mississippi 
It | remains to be seen | what 
We | have | a new CNN poll of polls 
It | has | Barack Obama 
McCain | hoping | his return 
Washington | is going to be seen | a sign of strong leadership 
even Republicans | are calling | it 
You | heard | Ed Rollins 
us | take | you 
what John McCain | did | today 
It | was just | noon 
the campaign trail | arrived | Capitol Hill 
his Senate office | greeted | his independent friend Joe Lieberman 
who | used to talk | reporters 
I | appreciate | it 
sir | > | BASH 
McCain | said | he 
his fellow Republicans | were declaring | a tentative agreement 
that | can pass | the House 
McCain | had | a different mission 
He | got | the underground subway 
the House | to talk | Republicans 
GOP sources | say | McCain 
others | discussed | ways 
who | do not think | it 
the government's role | to bail | out Wall Street 
he | was racing back | the Capitol 
McCain | said | he 
That | meant trying to pull | TV ads 
the campaign | stopped sending | reporters 
Joe Biden | attacked | McCain 
campaign aides | were | work 
Some | accompanied | McCain 
House Republicans | frustrated | the bailout 
you | look | the record of John McCain 
it | is | a consistent record of free market economics 
His presence | gives | us 
those ideals | are | the table 
We | believe | he 
I | think | it 
House Republicans | say | they 
McCain | insists | he 
himself | is | another giant McCain gamble 
you | 're working | your sources 
What | is | John McCain's position 
his official position | is | he 
that | is | purpose 
He | has | people 
he | is | the Senate 
they | say | he 
they | understand how | politically dicey this is 
I | 'm | A , B and C 
it | will be seen | A , B and C 
he | wants | this 
he | wants | it 
that | helps | taxpayers 
There | are | some discussions 
They | 're going | some of his colleagues 
who | are very close | him 
about | trying to find | a way 
they | 're being | him
