Senator Joe Biden | meet | the vice presidential debate 
It | 's going to be | the first 
you | have to see | the two candidates spar 
there | 's actually going to be | because these debate rules 
CBS News | aired | more of their conversation 
they | talked | Joe Biden 
Both | were asked | Roe 
you | think | Roe 
Wade | was | a good decision 
I | think | it 
that | can exist | a 
It | says | the first three months 
decision | should be left | the woman 
the government | has | a role 
They | have | a right 
they | say | the weight 
I | think | it 
I | believe | states 
it | is | no secret 
I | 'm | pro- life 
I | believe | a culture of life 
that | is | what 
I | would like to see | further 
we | 're going to show | you 
what | happened when | Katie Couric 
Palin | to name | any other Supreme Court rulings 
what | may happen | tomorrow night 
the running mates | are seasoned | debaters 
their styles | are | their views 
this | is | her 
she | was running | governor of Alaska 
she | was debating | former Democratic governor Tony Knowles 
It | was | a test 
you | aware now | the impact of that lack 
that | caused | the people of Alaska 
You | have | one minute 
I | have | no idea 
there | was | gridlock and much of that 
that memo | asking | your Cabinet 
ways | to put | the legislators 
this candidate | brings | an impressive array of skills 
I | 'm sitting here | them 
it | does n't get | hand 
We | asked | former Republican congresswoman Susan Molinari 
who | became | a TV anchor 
about | to view | Palin 
Biden | has | a serious challenge 
He | has to go | her 
It | is | a tough call 
Biden | has | at least two tendencies 
He | 's got | a reputation 
I | like | about 
you | is | your wife 
the " Los Angeles Times | said | addition 
Biden | is | a gaffe machine 
you | reassure | voters 
you | would have | the discipline 
you | would need | the world stage 
the primary debate Biden | sounded more | John McCain 
who | advocated defunding | the Iraq war 
Lives | are | stake 
I | knew | the right political vote 
I | tell | you 
Molinari | says debating | a woman 
Biden | will have to choose | his words 
He | ca n't risk | female voters 
His job | is going to be to defend | Senator Obama 
you | take | down 
Sarah Palin | not get | women 
> | > | JOHNS 
A Research Poll | shows | public expectations 
this debate | are | to 
It | 's going to be | a fascinating debate 
days | have been | rumors 
Palin | said | Katie Couric 
Tonight CBS News | aired | the question and answer 
that | had | so many people 
the great history of America | have been | rulings 
there | 's never going to be | absolute consensus 
there | are | those issues 
I | believe are best held | a state level 
there | would be | others 
you | think | any 
that | could best be dealt | a more local level 
I | would take | issue 
I | would n't be | a position 
it | reads | today 
who | supports | McCain 
who | supports | Obama 
conservative | say | Palin 
she | needs to be allowed to be | herself 
she | talked | her view 
I | thought | she 
she | held back | some of the kind 
that | is | each side of the abortion issue 
She | seems to understand | federalism 
Katie | asks | her this 
This | is straight | the conservative canon 
I | mean | every conservative 
you | do n't have to be | the governor of a state 
I | 'll help | you 
which | is | the case 
they | banished | school prayer 
which | was | a gay rights case 
which | is | a flag burning case 
It | was | a Miss South Carolina moment 
she | was | babbling 
I | 'm so staggered | the ignorance 
she | spoke | the Supreme Court ruling 
She | was | the results 
She | was | TV speaking 
What | do | you 
there | is | no question 
I | can tell | you 
It | could have happened | me 
you | got | the camera 
you | 're supposed to come | with 
you | need | a minute 
somebody | to throw | some ideas 
she | did n't have | a quick answer 
I | 'll guarantee | you 
I | 'll go | a number of them 
the Supreme Court | should not be taking away | those state rights 
she | tried to give | you 
this | is | a fill 
the blank test | running | vice president of the United States 
she | wants to -- ask | her 
she | 'd had | fine answers 
that | 's | what 
this | is | all about 
Gwen Ifill | is going to be | the moderator of the debate tomorrow tonight 
It | turns | out 
she | 's writing | a book 
that | is going to be published | inauguration day 
It | is | Barack Obama 
there | are | some conservatives 
who | are saying | this 
It | was disclosed | some newspaper articles months 
It | is | a blatant conflict of interest 
There | is | no question 
I | 've got to tell | you 
I | think | there 
Ifill | to be | she 
her | be | the moderator 
a lot of Democrats | are saying | this 
just part of a McCain campaign effort | to -- put | pressure 
it | is | a pretty sleazy thing 
You | know | she 
I | worked | Bill Clinton 
She | is | nails 
I | have probably called and screamed | her 
she | is | a very fair , tough-minded journalist 
it | is | no secret 
She | 's been working | this book 
It | is | the new generation of African-American and civil rights leader 
one of them | is | Barack Obama 
He | is now | the most famous 
He | 's got | a good chance 
it | includes | Artur Davis 
who | is | a remarkable young congressman 
It | 's got | a lot of civil rights leaders 
I | think | it 
the right wing | to try to be bullying | Gwen Ifill 
she | has | a vested interest 
It | is | nonsense 
that book | goes right | the charts 
I | wrote | a book 
I | got to leave | it 
I | have | a vested interest 
The presidential candidates | have | three debates 
Joe Biden | will go | head 
Who | 's going to win | tomorrow night's showdown 
we | 'll have | more 
it | get | the House 
We | 're going to keep and track | all the latest developments 
it | means | you 
We | 'll have | that 
The financial rescue plan | passing | the Senate tonight 
you | need to know when | 360
