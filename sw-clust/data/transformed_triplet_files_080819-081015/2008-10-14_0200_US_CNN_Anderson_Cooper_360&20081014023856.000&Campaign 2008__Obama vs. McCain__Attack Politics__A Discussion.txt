we | can feel | it 
there | is | a lot of anger 
There | is | anger 
there | is | anger 
there | is | anger 
there | is | anger 
She | did n't mention | the other kind of anger 
that | 's erupted | the trail 
a respected veteran of the civil rights movement | entered | the fray 
Democratic Congressman John Lewis | said | McCain and Palin 
He | talked | the climate of hate 
Governor George Wallace | fostered | Alabama 
he | said | he 
McCain | made | his anger clear 
it | stopped | me 
I | believed | John Lewis 
who | is | an American hero 
He | referred | the bombing of the church 
I | 'm not going to accept | it 
I | 'm going to reject | it 
that | is | the latest 
Congressman Lewis | was | way 
which | is essentially | what 
I | ca n't tell | you 
I | began to receive when | you 
the rhetoric | turned | these rallies 
what | is going | the chants 
You | cannot assign | every single comment 
that | was made | the entire campaign 
who | was living | that moment 
he | remembers | that 
he | calling | him 
No. | What | he 
I | 'm hearing | a hate 
I | 've got | a problem 
it | was completely | line 
> > | ED | ROLLINS 
I | think | it 
I | think | John McCain 
He | 's made | every effort 
I | do n't think | John Lewis 
I | hope | he 
I | have | great respect 
it | is | hero 
John McCain | had | a right 
I | want to -- just trying to pull | it 
I | want to read | you 
He | encouraged | campaign volunteers 
Obama and Osama bin Laden | saying | they 
both | have | friends 
that | bombed | the Pentagon 
What | do you think | that 
Where | is | this going 
All sorts of people | are going | the line 
He | had | every right 
I | think | he 
Sarah Palin | going to reject | the kind of comments 
that | have been made | their rallies 
they | have called | Obama 
they | have said | "off 
they | have said | him 
we | going to hear | words of repudiation 
that | 's been expressed | some of these rallies 
99.99 percent of the people | come | my rallies 
you | buy | that 
I | think | they 
they | 're | fine Americans 
there | are | people 
who | are showing | these rallies 
John Lewis | was | the sewing of hatred 
I | think | the George Wallace comparison 
John McCain | did | a good thing 
the other day | talking | that woman 
He | 's | an Arab 
He | is | a decent man 
he | showed | so much anger 
they | going to repudiate | some of the people 
who | are saying | these hateful things 
I | want to play | something 
a pastor | delivering | an invocation 
a McCain-Palin rally | said | this weekend 
us | play | that 
There | are | millions of people 
this world | praying | their God 
it | is | Hindu 
his opponent | wins | a variety of reasons 
I | pray | you 
the organization | ( | ph ) 
they | will think | their God 
he | 's basically saying | folks 
who | are praying | Obama 
it | has | nothing 
the McCain and | -- | McCain or Palin campaign 
a Christian | would have | the audacity 
That | is | what's 
a person | professes | their mouth 
Jesus Christ | is | their lord and savior 
you | do n't question | that 
he | knows | Obama 
He | knows | what 
we | 've seen | it 
we | ca n't control | what 
who | are saying when | we 
you | can pull | people 
This | is how | we 
you | can say | what 
That | is | a faith perspective 
That | is | an embarrassment 
who | preaches | the gospel 
sort | > | > ROLLINS 
we | 're | an ugly period of American politics 
We | 're polarized | the Congress 
We | 're polarized | the country 
there | is | intense people 
there | are | people 
They | argue | hatred 
They | think | that really this 
there | are | people 
who | hate | Barack Obama 
there | are | people 
who | hate | George Bush 
I | assume | it 
you | start hearing | people 
I | understand | what 
you | 're cheering | the USA 
who | does n't like | the United States 
you | 're | anti-U.S. McCain 
they | did | chant " USA 
Which | makes | no sense 
We | 're going to leave | it 
We | 're going to update | our breaking news 
We | 're looking | live pictures 
firefighters | are battling | two blazes 
it | is | kind of dark 
the | left there | the distance
