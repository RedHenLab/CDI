360 electoral map | showing | states 
yellow | are | the toss-up states 
I | find | it 
I | seem to be | the minority 
we | have | people 
who | are | much smarter 
who | can explain | it 
You | see | Obama 
223 electoral votes of 270 | needed to take | the White House 
who | are joining | me 
what | is | the latest 
What | are | the number 
? | > | KING 
we | have | new numbers 
This one | is now | Barack Obama 51 percent 
That | is | an improvement 
we | had | this one 
us | move | Michigan 
You | see | you 
these | are | likely voters 
you | compare | just a few weeks 
We | see | Barack Obama 
John McCain | has | the advantage 
I | am tonight | the state of Montana 
His forces | insist | it 
that | used to be | 2000 
the scenes | do | people 
John McCain | saw | those numbers 
today | coming | this idea 
the campaign | going back | Washington 
obviously | are pushing | the notion 
John McCain | did | this 
the edge | to try to change | the headlines 
he | 's losing | some ground 
the Gallup poll | is | a little 
The Obama campaign | traces | this back 
They | say | they 
you | ask | who 
They | see | an increase 
they | think | this 
McCain's way | trying to turn | the tables 
both | need to show | leadership 
Sarah Palin | was asked | McCain's campaign manager 
he | received | payments 
that | is | a problem 
she | said | Katie Couric 
My understanding | is | Rick Davis 
he | 's not benefiting | that 
I | would hope | that 
he | has | a stake 
my understanding | is | he 
I | would hope | that 
John McCain | has been saying | I 
they | are putting | her 
we | have | a debate 
That | will put | her 
there | is | one 
I | 'm | it 
we | will see | her there 
they | are having to put | her 
There | is | a lot of pressure 
I | 'm | we 
the debate | is going to happen | Friday 
I | think | the debate 
Washington | break | the next couple days 
you | have | lobbyists 
nobody | brings | this up 
They | care | the economy , period 
High school stunts | sending | a gorilla 
We | 'll have | the video 
his time-out | putting | his campaign
