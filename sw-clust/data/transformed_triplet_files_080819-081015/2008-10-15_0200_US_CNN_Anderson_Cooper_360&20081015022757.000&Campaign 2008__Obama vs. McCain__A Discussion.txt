America | is | worth fighting for 
( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ) | > | > MCCAIN 
We | hide | history 
We | make | history 
this election | get | this country 
( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ) | > | > COOPER 
Governor Sarah Palin | was also | that state today 
she | was interviewed | Rush Limbaugh 
The conservative radio host | asked | Sarah Palin 
THE RUSH LIMBAUGH SHOW" | > | > LIMBAUGH 
This | is | an attempt 
( LAUGHTER ) | > | > RUSH 
This | is | an attempt 
the media | to make | you 
they | 're really worried | the effectiveness 
I | guess | message 
they | do want | me 
I | care too much | this great country 
mainstream media | is not holding | Barack Obama accountable 
Palin | was | the only one talking 
news | saying | she 
who | is also | an Obama supporter 
you | surprised to hear | Sarah Palin 
the media | is trying to shut | her 
( LAUGHTER ) | > | > MARTIN 
I | have got | a column 
you | know | what 
you | 're | a real frontier woman 
who | totes | a gun 
you | are sitting there spitting | fire 
you | can talk | us 
who | want to ask | you 
She | wants to be | a safe zone 
she | does n't want to answer | any tough questions 
She | does n't want to answer | anything 
her husband | belonging | a party 
I | want to secede | the United States 
she | does n't want to talk | this whole issue of this abuse 
she | says | she 
She | wants to talk | the American people 
That | is | what 
You | had | this 
the other day | writing | they 
it | up | the media 
them | interact | a daily basis 
her | being freed | any point 
Both of these campaigns | are | message 
there | is | a reason 
Biden | is n't making | many mistakes 
He | 's toeing | the Obama line 
They | 've got | a lead 
They | 're trying to sit | it 
I | doubt | you 
she | has done | something 
the McCain campaign | could n't do | itself 
She | lifted | that campaign 
we | change | Washington 
this country | can renew | its strength 
This country | is | Washington 
Americans | understood how | it 
they | did n't trust | Washington 
That | is | that wave of anger 
Sarah Palin | can help galvanize | that 
Sarah Palin | talked | ACORN 
which | was basically doing | some phony voter Registration 
you | think | that 
which | resonates | the campaign trail 
it | seems to resonate | people 
she | got | the biggest hand 
it | 's working | the conservatives 
It | is actually | voter fraud 
She | keeps saying | it 
It | 's | voter fraud 
Voter fraud | is | someone 
it | is | Registration fraud 
It | 's bringing | names 
it | is resonating | conservative circles 
I | do n't think | it 
I | think | it 
Bill Ayers | to | most voters 
the big story | is up | Nevada 
they | found | evidence of fraud and voter Registration 
this | is | part 
Obama | pointed | out 
I | 've been running | voter Registration 
We | 've Registered | tons of people 
I | was just | North Carolina 
610,000 people | have been Registered | North Carolina 
That | is | what 
ACORN | has been | a sideshow 
he | get | a little fodder 
I | think | David's 
This | pleases | the base 
that | had | the most intense rallies and most energetic supporters 
American history | have been | McGovern and Goldwater 
They | fired up | the base 
I | do n't understand why | she 
I | understand | this whole controlled setting 
you | 're trying to get | a broader message 
you | ca n't talk | the base 
We | talked | what 
McCain | has to do | the coming weeks 
What | do you think | Barack Obama 
Barack Obama | has to do | more than sit 
I | think | Alex 
There | 's been too much | that 
I | think | he 
This | is | his final big message 
he | gives | these 
I | think | tomorrow night 
he | can probably put | it 
he | has | a convincing 
I | want | her 
We | 'll see | you 
We | discussed | voter Registration 
It | is | Register 
the deadline | has passed | a lot of states 
We | 've got | all the information
