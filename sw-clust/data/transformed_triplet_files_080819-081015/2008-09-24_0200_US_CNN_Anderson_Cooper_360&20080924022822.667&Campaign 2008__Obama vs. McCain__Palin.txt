you | going to support | the bailout plan 
Reporters | yelling | John McCain 
That | 's | they 
who | has been virtually cut | reporters 
She | 's given | two interviews 
Governor Palin | is now | New York 
her picture | taken | meeting 
The McCain camp | is hoping | the publicity 
those meetings | is going to boost | her foreign policy credentials 
the media | reached | a new level 
Ed Henry | has | the " Raw Politics 
> > | ED | HENRY 
Sarah Palin | seems to be enjoying | her foreign policy studies 
she | sought | his tutelage 
I | am going to give | him 
he | did | Georgia 
you | > | PALIN 
you | give | me 
The carefully choreographed photo-ops | were largely | a substance-free zone 
Palin | tapping | her heart 
she | learned | the president's 
What | is | his name 
which | means | the light of the house 
the McCain campaign | had tried to make | the meetings 
first refusing | to allow | reporters 
CNN, | said | they 
Governor Palin | can hold | her own 
her | hold | her own 
Republicans | say | Palin 
the McCain campaign | wants left | voters 
who | can close | the stature gap 
who | 's going to stand there | world leaders 
It | will take | more 
John McCain | is introducing | his running mate 
Your Daughter | to Work | Day 
Palin | is meeting | heads of state 
she | is | primetime 
Ed Henry | joins | us 
I | find | this remarkable 
common | is | this 
it | to have | reporters 
We | 're covering | the White House 
we | have to face | the White House 
They | want to let | cameras 
he | meets | foreign leaders 
we | push back | we 
we | wo n't show | the video 
they | allow | reporters 
most Americans probably | could n't care less | the media 
It | would probably win | Sarah Palin votes 
they | kept | the media out 
she | 's running | vice president 
she | has to start answering | questions 
She | has n't had | a full-pledged press conference 
Neither | has | Joe Biden 
you | do n't want | a lot of risk 
You | do n't want to make | some 
they | risk making | her 
it | makes them look | they 
she | 's going to say | something 
all of whom | are going to be | friendly 
Campbell Brown earlier | said | she 
it | was | sexist 
the McCain campaign | to be treating | her differently 
both sides | are trying to shut | reporters 
Sarah Palin | say | she 
She | does have | the experience 
you | want to roll | her 
you | 're ultimately going to have to let | her face 
she | faces | Joe Biden 
you | 're not going to have | any safety nets 
It | 's going to be | her 
you | keep | her 
they | have now rigged | the rules 
the vice-presidential debate | to make | exchanges 
it | appears | they 
us | get | her 
Conservatives | are fired up to have | her
