he | using | the playbook 
We | 're back | David Gergen 
who | has covered | both campaigns 
that | can be | a real winner 
It | is working | McCain 
the McCain team | has been | they 
they | learned | that 
some | have pointed | out 
Barack Obama | was winning | a steady streak of victories 
she | ran | ad 
she | went | the attack 
she | won | the bulk of the primaries 
the McCain campaign | has seen | that 
they | 're making | gains 
you | look | an average of state 
you | look | the Electoral College 
the election | were held | today 
this | is | a 
we | talked | last night 
she | ran | time 
it | be | sort of the same effective strategy 
I | think | that 
I | think | it 
The argument | is | a more effective argument 
they | have | the advantage 
they | 're going | more centrist voters 
who | will be | a much bigger deal 
they | were | those primaries and caucuses 
you | buy | the argument 
they | say | they 
they | have looked | this 
they | say | it 
it | came | the white working-class blue-collar voters 
that | is why | you 
he | 's going to be | Ohio 
He | 's going to go | Indiana 
he | is targeting | those voters 
You | saw | that clip of Hillary Clinton 
talk | is | change 
That | is why | you 
There | 's | a lot of that kind 
a lot | to be learned | the primary race 
What | do | you 
McCain | can take | that 
I | think | it 
she | did catch | those last 
I | think | that 
I | think | it 
he | 's now showing | it 
I | think | he 
I | think | this whole question 
a pro-choice vice president | is | a diversion 
I | 'm surprised | he 
himself | get | this 
I | think | it 
I | do n't think | it 
his DNA | to go | the attack 
he | needs | someone 
his side | to help | him 
he | needs to run | a team 
He | needs to make | this the Democrats 
he | could be | serious trouble 
this campaign | is taking much more | serious turn 
I | think | anyone 
David | said | this kind of a counterattack 
the attack | is particularly | John McCain's DNA 
He | 's doing | it 
he | has | that Hillary Clinton 
they | believe | it 
you | may disagree | him 
one | may disagree | him 
he | believes | Barack Obama 
these | are | dangerous times 
the central challenge of the next president | is | national security 
he | believes | he 
That | animates | him 
he | 's not very animated | too many other things 
we | have to end | it
