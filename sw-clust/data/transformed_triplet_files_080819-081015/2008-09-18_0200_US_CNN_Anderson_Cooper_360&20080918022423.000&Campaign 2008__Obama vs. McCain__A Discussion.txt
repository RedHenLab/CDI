( LAUGHTER ) | >> | > COOPER 
us | dig | CNN senior political analysts David Gergen 
David | is also | a former presidential adviser 
Gloria | is | a columnist 
the campaign | has entered | a new phase 
you | see | this now 
you | see | it 
neither candidate | has yet demonstrated | a mastery of this economic situation 
Neither | has offered | a clear plan 
Neither | has really shown | an urgency 
I | think | you 
Barack Obama | has gained | this more 
he | can blame | it 
he | is making | a forceful argument 
that | helps | him 
John McCain today | coming | Sarah Palin 
that | seem | yesterday 
( LAUGHTER ) | > | > GERGEN 
I | think | the 
There | is | a little momentum 
he | has n't yet fully seized | it 
John McCain | could still take | it 
Biden | have targeted | their criticisms 
You | do n't even hear | them 
you | agree | that 
I | think | it 
McCain | is | a really difficult situation 
he | 's also got to take | a turn 
which | is | something 
he | has been talking | the last two decades 
he | makes | is 
this | is | those corrupt CEOs 
I | 'm | a populist 
I | 'm | your side 
It | is | kind of a difficult argument 
He | 's working | it 
it | goes | everything 
he | has been telling | us 
David Gergen | made | the point 
neither candidate | has really been | kind of own this 
the president | do | the economy 
I | think | you 
the McCain camp start | to go | that road 
McCain | may need to start | doing is 
they | are pegging | him 
I | 'm | a senator 
it | is | a different ball game 
I | have got | veto power 
I | have | a soapbox 
It | is | a much different scenario 
he | was | Washington 
What | did | he 
McCain | can make | the argument 
presidency | is | a different ball game 
There | are | pitfalls 
it | is | a hard argument 
the president | ca n't do much | the economy 
no one | wants to hear | that 
That | 's not going to be | something 
There | are | two things 
George Bush | has been | this 
the country | understand | what 
it | is | we 
what | is going | the banking industry 
it | was | crisis 
he | explained | it 
President Bush | has not done | that 
he | 's got | very high negative ratings 
it | is still | more confidence 
who | is getting | high marks 
he | is handling | this 
I | think | others 
the Federal Reserve | is getting | high marks 
there | is | a sense 
it | is | home 
there | are | some steps 
it | is | a new resolution trust 
we | had | the 
we | just simply going to wait | January 
March | to think | that 
There | is | a question of a new stimulus package 
we | have | some 
we | have | a meltdown 
the stock market today | entered | dangerous new territory 
There | is | a real flight 
neither of these candidates | are known | their economic expertise 
they | were to tell | you 
they | would also have to tell | you 
they | are making | this campaign 
everything | may right now be going | the drain 
they | are | a 
they | 're | really an uncertain situation 
that | is why | you 
I | was | the campaign trail 
he | kept saying | fight 
We | are going to fight | we 
that | is | what 
his reputation | is | all about 
the Obama campaign | thinks | they 
it | is | a question 
that | is where | Barack Obama 
I | think | Obama 
he | has started to put | some meat 
What | am | I 
I | will fight | a bipartisan commission 
that | is | what 
I | have seen | a few of those 
you | seen | a few of those 
We | 're going to have to leave | it 
we | are going to be talking | this
