there | is so | what 
a candidate | tick | that most people 
we | 're offering | two special reports 
tomorrow night | to help | you 
a better decision | come | November 
who | is here | a preview 
that | is | Barack Obama 
He | does n't really let | the grass 
There | is | a great story 
He | says | he 
he | was really kind | frustrated 
There | was | a project 
they | were trying to get | asbestos 
It | took | two years 
it | was | kind of his undoing 
it | came | community organizing 
He | felt | the power 
he | made | this turn 
I | want | you 
This | is right | his mother 
he | came | a lot 
He | returned | Chicago more focused and ready 
state Senator Alice Palmer | tapped | Obama 
he | jumped | the chance 
State Senator Ricky Hendon | was | Palmer's friend 
Barack | had | a discussion 
him | replacing | her 
she | went | Congress 
there | was | an agreement 
She | lost | the race 
she | decided | she 
I | 'm going to run | re-election 
Palmer | asked | Obama 
There | is | no way Barack 
Obama | knew | he 
he | played | hardball 
He | looked | her nominating petitions 
she | had to submit | the board of elections 
they | were put together | a real hurry 
petitions | did not do | a good job 
The rules | are there | a reason 
Will Burns | was | an Obama volunteer 
who | helped him challenge | Palmer's petition 
you | do | the middle of a race 
you | look | the signatures 
Obama | knocked | Alice Palmer 
today | promotes | him 
he | was | an avid student of Chicago-style politics 
he | had | some complications 
he | should knock | this woman 
David Mendel | is | a Chicago reporter 
who | wrote | Obama's biography 
we | saw | the first real example of Barack Obama's cutthroat nature 
you | called | it 
you | think | he 
you | see | that out 
We | saw | today 
he | is | a lot 
I | 'm not going to let | anybody 
That clip | was | anything 
it | was certainly | kind of that brass-knuckles politics 
he | learned | that city 
you | talked | friends 
who | never even opened | about 
that | surprised | you 
It | is | a lot of times 
we | talk | the fact 
he | has n't been around | political circles 
you | talk | his friends 
you | see | his life story 
he | is | a shrewd politician 
There | were | times 
he | realized | he 
kind | get | his head 
the kind of academic intellectual role | really deal | people 
There | were | several times 
He | joined | these poker games 
He | was | really kind of one 
that | was | really a way 
he | had | that entree 
he | made | transition
