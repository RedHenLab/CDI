It | could be | a record turnout 
we | began naming | the " Ten Most Wanted Culprits of the Collapse 
we | 're going to be adding | another name 
a bunch of politicians | are telling | us 
now | is | the time 
You | should know | these people 
You | should know | their names 
You | should know | their faces 
you | should know | what 
they | 've done how | they 
AIG | became | one of our ten most wanted 
other AIG executives | came | with financial instruments

He | is | Richard Fuld 
it | is | no wonder 
" magazine | says | CEO 
Fuld | was paid | around $ 500 million 
he | is | the hot seat 
you | have n't discovered | your role 
you | 're | the villain

I | have | a very basic question 
there | is | nothing 
John Egan | evaluates | companies 
He | says | Fuld 
the kind of guy | to fall | his sword 
the firm | gets | trouble 
he | would be | the first 
line | to make | the sacrifices 
Fuld | is | the guy 
who | ramped | up Lehman's business and mortgage-related securities 
he | got | deeper 
Lehman | wound | thinking people 
we | go | now when everybody 
a state of quasi-panic | buy | a lot of these things 
we | 'll make | a lot of money 
it | was | a bad debt 
Lehman | needed | billions 
cash | to keep | the company 
just five days | declaring | bankruptcy 
assets | did n't explicitly say | anything 
I | remind | you 
you | 're | oath 
we | did not mislead | our investors 
we | made | disclosures 
he | should have known | the company 
it | creates | another problem 
he | is either | a liar 
Most people | know | the rest 
that | continues | today 
that | is why | Lehman Brothers and CEO 
We | asked | an interview 
we | were referred back | his congressional testimony 
I | extend | an interview opportunity 
There | is | an investigation

We | 're told | they 
investors | were misled | anything company officials

Women | twice helped | George W. Bush 
Sarah Palin | is | the big draw
