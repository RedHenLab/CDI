Barack Obama | shared | a stage 
Saturday's event | was billed | a faith forum 
the questions | reflected | the slogan 
Warren | asked | both candidates 
part of our commitment | bringing | you 
you | can make | your own minds 
What point | is | a baby 
( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ) | > | > MCCAIN 
I | have | a 25-year pro-life record 
I | will be | a pro-life president 
this presidency | will have | pro-life policies 
That | is | my commitment 
( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ) | > | > MCCAIN 
That | is | my commitment 
I | believe | Roe 
I | come | that conclusion 
I | do n't think | women 
I | think | they 
they | wrestle | these things 
this | is where | I 
we | can find | common ground 
I | have now inserted | this 
we | reduce | the number of abortions 
The fact | is | we 
who | is opposed | abortion 
What | been | your greatest moral failure 
what | has been | the great 
They | do n't get | any easier 
( LAUGHTER ) | > | > WARREN 
they | do n't get | any easier 
( LAUGHTER ) | > | > MCCAIN 
I | have been | a very imperfect person 
It | is | my greatest moral failure 
I | think | America's greatest moral failure 
we | have not devoted | ourselves 
we | 've been | the best 
I | think | 
people | to go | shopping 
we | should have told | Americans 
the military , | expand | our volunteers 
APPLAUSE ) | > | > MCCAIN 
The first words of your very successful book | is | This 
You | know | what 
( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ) | > | > OBAMA 
I | had | a difficult youth 
My father | was | the house 
I | have written | this 
there | were | times 
I | experimented | drugs 
I | drank | my teenage years 
I | traced | this to 
I | was so obsessed | me 
I | might be dissatisfied | I 
I | think | the process 
me | growing | was 
it | 's | me 
Saturday's forum | was | a chance 
McCain and Obama | to reach | conservative Christian voters 
we | 're pulling | the scorecards 
I | hope | I 
( LAUGHTER ) | > | > BROWN 
me | ask | you 
What | did you think | McCain's performance 
I | know | you 
his ability | to connect | evangelicals 
I | think | he 
it | was | the closest look 
we | have had | contrast 
I | think | he 
he | was | very concise 
I | think | he 
it | is up | him 
these views | are going to play | his administration 
He | spoke openly | his religious faith 
Some | say | he 
I | think | he 
a good job | defining | what 
it | means to be | a Christian 
I | 'm saved | I 
I | think | he 
a Christian | is having | a personal , transforming relationship 
evangelical Christians | were looking | a statement 
I | think | he 
He | could have said | that 70 percent of all abortions 
he | called | maternity leave 
that | would keep | women 
they | did n't want to have | abortions 
he | could have spelled | what 
he | would reduce | abortion 
He | could have been | more specific 
I | think | the question 
just | to make | I 
what point | is | a baby 
Obama | was | his answer 
it | is | my pay grade 
that | should make | people 
he | is | prime time 
he | was | some things 
he | made | reference 
We | have not paid | abortions 
you | want | more of something 
you | make | it 
that | is | what 
he | 's moving radically | the other way 
which | is | he 
what | do | you 
I | think | he 
I | 'm going to agree | Tony Perkins 
I | would go | a step... > > BROWN 
he | is | a pro- choice candidate 
Richard Land of The Southern Baptist Convention | pointed | that 71 percent of evangelicals 
that | is | a big change 
Eighty-two percent of evangelicals | voted | George Bush 
There | seems to be | a shift 
that | is | Obama 
These | are | issues 
they | are moving | his direction 
what | do | you 
Pew Research | shows | young evangelicals 
I | would think | the 
kind of get | lost | that 
Intensity | is | the issue 
I | will say | Barack Obama 
He | made | grounds 
he | could lose | all of it 
he | chooses | a pro-abortion running mate 
even | is | he 
which | could totally blow | any gains 
he | made | Saturday night 
we | have to end | it
