We | begin | breaking news 
a new bill | slightly altered to be voted | tomorrow 
Wall Street | had already closed when | word 
We | will show | you 
Jessica Yellin | is | Washington 
the Senate | has announced | they 
That | means | they 
the House | gets | a crack 
They | have changed | the legislation 
They | 're going to include | a few new measures 
This | includes | an increase 
the federal government | will insure | you 
it | is | $ 100,000 now 
It | would increase | that amount 
That | 's designed to help | small businesses 
Other add-ons | include | new measures 
physical illnesses | are covered | a whole bunch of tax packages 
we | do | the alternative minimum tax 
They | 're | all things 
that | are considered | different people 
they | pass | this bill 
it | will go | the House 
That | is | their hope 
it | 's going to pressure | House members 
House members | did n't pass | their version of the bill 
it | is | a done deal 
I | have been talking | congressional aides 
who | are scratching | their heads 
certain measures | are going to cause | them 
they | pick | as many votes and more 
they | need to do | more 
this hour | are | this 
the Senate kind | watching | the news 
that | was seen | the House 
yesterday | just deciding | they 
they | want to continue to take | action 
this continual motion | is | a positive thing 
You | asked | outrage 
both sides | are getting are | voters 
who | want | them 
They | 're getting | a few more calls 
the overwhelming momentum | is | voters 
who | do not think | this 
the pressure | is still | members 
many of their constituents | are n't | this 
we | mentioned | the top 
we | have | now two records day 
either one | might be | a fatal mistake 
There | are | bigger things 
Ali Velshi | is here | the 
there | is | a tendency 
it | is | up 400 or so points 
It | is | a convenient number 
we | can track | the Dow 
We | ca n't track | the credit markets 
I | 'm | I 
banks | have to borrow | money 
an overnight based | is now | the highest 
it | 's ever been | today 
There | is | a credit freeze 
it | was | last week 
you | heard | politicians 
sort of that deadline | getting | this 
markets | opened | Monday 
It | would be advised | people 
We | need to fix | this problem 
Markets | are following | Washington 
It | 's | the other way 
the | -- | the 
the stock market | is | a weak barometer of the economy 
individuals | to borrow | money 
it | is | the banks 
the banks | need to borrow | money 
that | need | those loans 
we | have already seen | major corporations 
that | starts to flow | all the way 
all the way | has n't come | a halt 
you | have | a mortgage 
you | happen to have | great credit 
you | will still get | that loan 
there | is | a word 
there | is | a deal 
it | is | a real deal 
there | is still | a chance 
it | 's not going to necessarily free | credit markets 
that | is why | I 
this | might be | a bit of a head fake 
we | did n't think | the Senate 
It | is | the House 
that deal | may be | Thursday 
It | may be | that 
That | is when | you 
we | think | some 
that | are | trouble 
that | will start to flow down | individuals 
it | is | a Main Street issue 
Washington | has got | a big selling job
