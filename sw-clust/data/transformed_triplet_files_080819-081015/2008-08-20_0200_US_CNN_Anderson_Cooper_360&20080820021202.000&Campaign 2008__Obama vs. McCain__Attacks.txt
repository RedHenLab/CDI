I | will let | no one question 
I | love | America 
( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ) | > | > OBAMA 
I | love | America 
weeks of attack ads | comparing | him 
Paris Hilton | mocking | his popularity 
the trail | suggesting | Senator Obama 
a war | lose | the election 
Bloomberg | showing | his positives 
that | is | nothing 
there | is | a Democratic twist 
We | get | the " Raw Politics 
It | 's | Groundhog Day 
The presumptive Democratic nominee | is still fending | those nagging questions 
McCain | questioning | Obama 
HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGN AD | > | > NARRATOR 
It | is | 3:00 a.m. 
Hillary Clinton | was running | those ads 
There | are | few accidents 
this | is | n't one of them 
It | looks like | the Clinton campaign 
not | gave | the McCain people 
they | started | them 
McCain | has n't just lifted | a few pages 
It | looks more | he 
Obama | giving | great speeches 
there | is | one thing 
it | is | a great speech 
I | hope | you 
his ideas | are always | his rhetoric 
It | is | deja vu 
There | is | a big difference 
some people | may think | words 
you | take | a closer look 
the McCain campaign | is actually doing | Hillary Clinton one better 
she | got | Obama 
she | was never | consistently negative 
you | bring | him 
it | becomes | a much more direct 
there | is | a danger 
Clinton | threw | these punches 
Obama | came out looking | the grownup 
I | think | there 
I | do n't think | there 
anything | really did | any serious damage 
I | think | it 
What | does n't kill | me 
McCain | is still pressing | votes 
Democrats | is | he 
the one | written | George W. Bush 
himself | fire back | today
