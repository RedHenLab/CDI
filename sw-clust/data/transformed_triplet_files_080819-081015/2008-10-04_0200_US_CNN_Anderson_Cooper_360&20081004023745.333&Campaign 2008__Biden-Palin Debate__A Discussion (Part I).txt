to advocate | change | the circumstances 
we | find | ourself 
middle class people | change | the circumstances 
we | find | ourselves 
I | hope | for 
she | 's no longer judged | 15 second sound bites 
you | saw | somebody genuineness 
you | saw | somebody 
he | wants to take | the world 
Surrogates | talking | the spin 
I | do n't know why | we 
it | is | just pure spin 
they | named | the room 
We | 're taking | a look 
the candidates | said | last night's debate 
Senator Biden | rolled | a lot of numbers 
They | unleashed | their barrage of accusations 
she | cut | taxes 
Obama | believes | the surge 
Who | 's telling | the truth 
both vice-presidential candidates | took | liberties 
Iraq | is | something Senator McCain 
Senator Obama | was | it 
Governor Palin | said | this . > > PALIN 
Barack Obama | ca n't admit | the surge 
Obama | wants | our troops 
he | says | the surge 
Obama | has been criticized | his views 
Biden | went | McCain 
John McCain | said as recently | a couple weeks 
he | would n't even sit | the government of Spain 
America | has had strained | relations 
McCain | was interviewed | it 
he | did not commit | one way 
Biden | says | this 
it | let | the free market move 
he | did | the banking industry 
McCain | wants | some deregulation but nothing 
the extensive lack of oversight | being blamed | many banking problems 
Palin | says | Biden 
Higher taxes | asking | higher tax 
Biden | says making | more than a quarter million 
a year | should pay | more 
middle class Americans | helping | the economy 
There | are | plenty of other examples 
Palin | said | Obama 
94 times | to increase | taxes 
More than half those votes | came | budget resolutions 
fibs | misleading | statements 
both sides | goes | on and no doubt 
that | is | what 
it | will continue doing right | the election 
us | dig | deeper 
Republicans | celebrated | Palin's debate performance 
last night | saying | it 
What kind of an impact | do you think | she 
she | 's going to have | boisterous crowds 
she | 's also promised to do | far more media 
We | may be back | a Katie Couric moment 
she | is | herself 
she | said | she 
John McCain's decision | to pull | Michigan 
she | sent | an e-mail 
us | not do | this 
She | wants to go back | there 
I | 've never heard | a vice-presidential candidate 
you | think | she 
it | is | the maverick 
I | 've never seen | anything 
She | 's going to be | a little unpredictable 
she | 'll probably get | a lot of media 
I | think | it 
there | 's going to be | a lot of attention 
he | 's | a potted plant 
he | is | his own offensive 
Obama | handle | things 
just kind of try | to run | the clock 
he | 's been hammering | McCain 
Bush | try to come | with something 
he | just kind | play 
it | is | his interests 
this point | to come | any specifics 
you | get | the bigger target 
you | are | terms of plans 
he | has got | the wind 
He | has ever | any Democrat 
The economy | did n't change | they 
People | are still paying | horrendous gasoline prices 
who | were being foreclosed | yesterday 
The elements | favor | Democrats 
The Democrat | is | Barack Obama 
I | think | they 
It | is pretty close | that 
The movement | is | his direction 
they | tend to be | more interventionist 
The country | is | a little intervention 
Obama | does n't have to do | that much new 
Sarah Palin | is now going to be doing | more media 
she | will do | more media of all stripes 
you | see | her 
conservative TV | > | JENNIFER DONAHUE 
I | think | she 
women | do | her 
the women | who | her 
she | helps solidify | some women 
women | moving quickly | Obama 
They | 're trying to stop | the hemorrhaging 
the key | is | this 
she | held | her own 
she | is | a smart lady 
The next debate | is | Tuesday 
That | is | the one 
The only thing McCain | could have done to put | a tourniquet 
his candidacy | would have been to vote | the bailout bill 
this bill | is | pork 
It | is | pork 
it | is | pork 
I | 'll vote | it 
I | 'll show | leadership 
this | is why | I 
having | had | that stroke 
I | do n't see how | he 
I | do n't see how | he 
It | is | him 
I | think | he 
this Bill | persuaded | Republicans 
he | could have brought | the pillars 
he | could have brought | the whole pillars of his campaign 
I | understand | it 
he | would be blamed | every single drop 
he | had come | it 
the Republicans | would have defeated | the bill 
I | see | what 
they | did n't hold | one minute of hearings 
that | are meant to hold | hearings 
I | 'm not trying to argue | the bill 
I | am trying to argue | there 
this bill | had not passed | this thing 
the problem | is | the voters 
The voters | say | you 
you | 're | rewarding Wall Street 
you | have to do | what's right 
he | had done | what's wrong 
I | 'm telling | it 
I | 'm | it 
I | think | they 
that | would have pleased | both parties 
We | 'll continue | this 
We | got | more of our panel 
Katie Couric that | caused | her 
She | kind | of 
what | 's going | her mind 
she | did n't say | what newspapers 
she | reads | we 
she | says | she 
all the best political team members | are watching | their laptop 
we | 'll tell | you 
he | is | what 
he | was really watching when | we 
all | were talking | important things
