I | hope | you

Jill Biden | is | no stranger

we | turn | the Democrats 
360's David Mattingly | has | an up-close look 
She | 's been quietly married | a U.S. senator 
Jill Biden | has suddenly become | an important voice 
all | care | health care 
She | is | a working woman 
She | is | a mother 
She | is | a grandmother 
She | understands | a lot of the concerns 
there | are | a lot of Americans 
she | speaks | a Washington outsider 
Senator Joe Biden | commuted to work | the train 
Jill Biden | stayed | Delaware 
She | pursued | her own teaching career 
that | claimed | the life of a friend 
Jill Biden | says | it 
that | convinced | her husband 
this time | to run | president 
Jill Biden | is n't staying | Delaware 
(voice-over | ) | We 
I | 'm | an educator 
I | feel | home 
She | 's gone | record 
she | would have never been | she 
The couple | wed | 1977 
young daughter | were killed | a car wreck 
Jill | became | a mother 
Biden's two young boys | giving | birth 
her husband | reported | income 
That | is relatively | Senate standards 
she | 's | campaigning 
Jill Biden | continues to teach | a Delaware community college 
no announced plans | to give | her day job 
all | are courting | the female vote 
older | went | the polls 
numbers | were | 74 percent 
Who | has | the edge 
Sarah Palin | making | an impact 
We | 're | Uncovering America
