Jury selection | began today | Vegas 
Simpson's | charged | armed robbery and kidnapping 
It | is | a strange case 
Jeffrey Toobin | joins | us 
I | try to play | it 
who | may have forgot | it 
( | EXPLETIVE | DELETED) 
you | think | you 
my ( EXPLETIVE DELETED ) | sell | it 
( | EXPLETIVE | DELETED) 
you | think | you 
a case | is | this 
This | seems | a very peculiar case 
this | is | a dispute 
that | was supposedly | sale 
O.J. | did have | some claim 
I | see | it 
somebody | brought | guns 
O.J. | authorized | the guns 
me | is | the only issue 
that | makes | this a real criminal case 
it | seems | a bunch of jerks 
there | is | this tape 
it | seems | a set-up 
that | mitigate | what 
the alleged victim | taped | it 
advance | suggested | he 
None of these characters | are | all admirable , respectable or even perhaps believable 
it | started to get | it 
Las Vegas | going to punish | him 
they | could ask | the perspective jurors 
they | thought | O.J. 
you | think | O.J. Simpson 
That | is | what 
the judge | said | no 
the jurors | are nursing | prejudices 
she | going to find | somebody 
who | does n't have | an opinion 
You | do n't have to have | no 
you | do n't have to have not heard | the O.J. case 
you | ca n't be nursing | a grudge 
You | ca n't have made | your mind 
what | is | the world's biggest difficulty 
I | think | the difficulty 
a crime | took | place 
this | was just | a bunch of crazy guys 
you | believe | the guns 
they | were just screaming | each other 
that | be | a criminal case 
I | think | the hardest thing 
a crime | took | place 
These people | are genuinely | victims 
O.J. | knew | the guns 
that | goes badly | him 
he | did n't know | the guns 
he | did n't know | the guns 
he | has at least | an arguable claim 
he | thought | the stuff 
he | 's just going | the hotel room and yelling 
the best piece of stuff | is | the suit 
he | was wearing when | he 
I | have | a hard time 
there | is | a big market 
he | has | it 
it | 's | big a market 
he | sold | a lot of things
