negotiations | are | way 
the administration's bailout deal | stalled | this afternoon 
It | happened | an emergency economic meeting 
The meeting | broke | a big way 
conservative Republicans | threw | an alternate rescue plan 
the table and | dug | their heels 
Barack Obama | were | the room 
We | 're told | Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson 
Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke | were just | meetings 
He | says | it 
we | had | this morning 
I | would just tell | you 
the president | has got to go | work 
We | are not going to come | a conclusion 
I | know | my colleagues 
we | will continue working | this 
this | be | a clear warning 
they | want to be | a part of this 
The president | laid | what 
the whole idea of bipartisanship | seems to be | the window 
We | will have | also details 
who | sold | some of its assets 
We | will get | that 
It | is | your money 
> > | ED | HENRY 
It | was | one of those days 
things | are | they 
Everybody | starts | all smiles 
> | > | GEORGE W. BUSH 
we | know | we 
this meeting | is | an attempt 
My hope | is | we 
a crush of cameras | waited | outside 
the room | say | the meeting 
A Democrat | called | it 
The meeting | blew up | House Republican Leader John Boehner 
a plan | to force | companies 
bad debt | to buy | insurance 
Barack Obama | pressed | Boehner 
Democrats | say | he 
Obama | asked | Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson 
We | had n't gotten | an agreement 
There | is still | a lot of different opinions 
it | 's flawed | the beginning 
The meeting | ended | passing motorcades 
Boehner | tried to rally | support 
Democrats | vowed to keep | it 
Members of Congress | are going | e 
who | said bringing | the two presidential nominees weeks 
the election | might solve | the crisis 
John McCain | is showing | no signs 
Republican and Democratic sources | say | McCain 
lawmakers of both parties | guessing | he 
Republicans | are standing | McCain's decision 
It | ended | Barack Obama 
he | would return | Washington today 
McCain | is | the underdog 
he | has to take | risks 
Democrats | say | McCain's move 
that | was already | the table 
What | was | many today 
Ed | joins | us 
the bottom line | is | there 
There | 's much | a hope of a deal 
a president | is running out | options 
I | remember | a time 
the president | could practically snap | his fingers 
he | wanted | Republicans 
he | sent | Vice President Cheney 
the Hill | to try to twist | arms 
That | did | n't work 
The president | had | a nationally televised address 
That | did | n't work 
he | has | this meeting 
They | 're running out | options 
this afternoon | is | both members of both parties 
key members of both parties | announced | they 
We | saw | a statement 
who | said | they 
They | 're talking | your money 
Tom Foreman | takes | a look 
days of wrangling and warnings | looming | disaster 
Republicans | side | side 
the bailout | looks | a go 
Everybody | knows | we 
I | expect | we 
that | can pass | the House 
Congress | wants | substantial changes 
Initial authorization | would be given | up to $ 350 billion 
$ 350 billion more | could be added | necessary 
Congress | would get | bipartisan oversight 
The government | would get | actual shares 
that | benefit | the money 
the deal | would limit | pay 
the tentative agreement | had barely been announced when | cracks 
they | characterize | an avalanche of public complaints 
they | want to beef | existing federal programs 
more private investors | to buy | those bad debts 
Powerful Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama | showed | waving notes 
The Paulson plan | is | a bad plan 
It | will not solve | problems 
It | will create | more problems 
None of that | means | the deal 
presidential adviser Ed Gillespie | is | just what 
> > | ED | GILLESPIE 
That | 's breaking | news 
us | dig | CNN's Jessica Yellin 
who | is | Capitol Hill 
we | know | what 
we | know | that division 
the House Republicans | are still far apart | everyone else 
this | is | the person 
they | designated to go | this meeting tonight 
they | have already called essentially | a lame duck 
who | does not speak | the House Republican conference 
I | spoke | some top aides 
They | say | he 
there | was | nobody 
you | heard | Dodd 
The Democrats | are accusing | the House Republicans 
what | happened | earlier today 
John McCain | met | House Republicans 
we | know | what 
how much | does | John McCain 
House Republicans | to go | the plan 
There | was always | a strong and significant group of House Republicans 
that | has been opposed | this plan 
they | take | issue 
you | heard | John 
they | do n't like | the taxpayers 
They | say | they 
They | presented | John McCain one of the alternatives 
John McCain | did not sign | the House Republicans 
this | was always | a problem 
the Democrats | were trying to rush forward | a deal 
they | could say | they 
Democrats | see | it 
They | say | John McCain 
he | injected | politics 
it | derailed | the thing 
It | depends how | you 
Chris Dodd | has just said | there 
It | is | one of these situations 
we | see | no likely end 
all sides | say | they 
something | done | the time 
the | could be | a deal solution 
a solution | is | the White House 
the House Republicans | try to come | terms 
That | can move | things 
you | would see | a bill 
the markets | do n't go | bonkers 
They | need to have | something 
something | agreed to | Monday 
We | are going to be blogging | the hour 
You | can join | the conversation 
You | can go | the Web site
