his campaign | is doing to help | the area 
his | take | the Bush administration 
that | is | upstaged day 
We | will look | the political repercussions 
it | says | John McCain 
the governor | making | her 
We | will also talk | this 
We | 're | the next two hours 
we | begin | the storm 
last | reported | 35 miles 
that | was | 7:00 p.m. National Weather Service bulletin 
We | can expect | a new one 
we | will bring | you 
Gustav | roared | the Gulf Coast 
that | had already killed | some 20 people 
Landfall | came | mid-morning 
the eye | crossed | Cocodrie 
Gustav | was downgraded | a Category 2 hurricane 
its destructive power | would pound | the coastline 
CNN's Sean Callebs | was | the middle of it 
The winds | have really picked | the last hour 
The high winds | downed | trees 
I | find | a live shot 
This | has been | the largest evacuation 
The greatest threats | were only | the skies 
They | came | the water 
Gustav's storm surge | crashed | the city's levees 
whitecapped waves | washing | the Industrial Canal 
Mayor Ray Nagin | told | CNN of another concern 
We | have | two large Navy ships 
that | were | there 
they | 're pinned | the wharf 
they | get loose | they 
we | could have | a major problem 
The hurricane | left | nearly 500,000 Louisiana households and offices 
the damage | could reach | the billions of dollars 
dozens of communities | were spared | the devastation 
President Bush | commended | the nearly two million people 
who | complied | voluntary and mandatory evacuations 
> | > | GEORGE W. BUSH 
It | is | a citizen 
stakes | move | their home 
that | comes when | you 
I | want to thank | those citizens 
who | listened carefully | the local authorities 
Gustav | continued to batter | the Gulf Coast 
there | was report | a private levee 
Plaquemines Parish | was | danger 
all of us | witnessed | exactly three years 
It | could have been | a lot 
We | 're still getting | some heavy , very heavy , rain bands 
We | may get knocked | the air 
It | is | a strange thing 
these heavy rain bands | have knocked | us 
The rain | is | times 
our satellite signal | cannot get | it 
we | do get knocked | the air 
Erica Hill | will take | New York 
We | are going to check | Chad Myers 
we | do | that 
us | go | Plaquemines Parish 
a private levee | is | the focus 
I | can tell | you 
things | were | 4:00 
it | was blown apart | both sides 
There | was | seepage 
the Saint Bernard side | coming | the railroad track gate 
that | was closed | the levee 
the other side | was where | the real panic 
I | think | we 
The Plaquemines Parish president | was | the radio begging 
anybody | to come | sandbags 
They | did n't have | any 
untold agencies | were down | so many sandbags 
they | solved | the problem 
they | opened | another gate 
it | was | a very brief of moment 
I | think | the real story 
all these government agencies | are | this storm 
That | was | a complete difference 
I | do n't know | I 
I | want to tell | you 
We | thought | this baby 
it | is really still coming | hard 
you | have done | a lot 
you | have to say | the levees 
the levees | performed well | a test 
Gustav | did n't provide | that test 
that | tells | us 
the levees | are indeed | they 
that | is | all 
people | care | about 
we | talked | last night 
I | was there | 4:00 
it | was holding | just fine 
it | could be | a whole different story 
we | are going to watch | that very 
We | will check | Drew 
360's John Zarrella | is | the ground 
it | was | a few hours 
you | said | just a few moments 
people | were really breathing | a sigh of relief 
that | is certainly | the case 
Gustav | was really rapidly losing | its punch 
it | got here | Lafayette 
You | can see | the water 
that | is | normally dry land 
the water | came up | five 
That | is | the Vermilion River 
the water | is still being pushed up | Vermilion Bay 
it | seems to have leveled | a bit 
our colleague Ed Lavandera | managed to make | it 
you | got closer | the Gulf 
there | might be | some extensive flooding 
there | might be | some bad damage 
that | were ripped | off 
worse | had | it 
about 40 percent of the power | is | the city 
we | did have | one death 
a tree | fell | somebody's house 
That | is | a tragic story 
city and local officials | are telling | us 
we | think | we 
We | will try to check | you 
you | can believe | it 
us | get now | the latest 
there | are | two more storms 
you | know | what 
Josephine | came | the African coast 
that | is still | 10 days 
it | does n't have | a name 
It | has | a number 
We | will focus | the G. 
we | will go | the H 
we | will go | the I. 
the G , Gustav , | dying | it 
Winds | are still | 50 
We | expect | it 
There | is | an Alexandria 
you | are getting pounded | very heavy rainfall 
Some areas | have picked up | almost 10 inches of rainfall 
There | are | your squalls 
many of those | just sliding | a little bit 
That | may help | you 
certainly another squall | coming | your city 
you | 're | 27 miles 
That | is | the story 
it | moves away and on | Arkansas 
we | need to keep | this thing 
it | is going to be | a flood maker 
it | spreads | rain 
that | is | great news 
Missouri | spread | that rain 
The next storm | is | the H storm 
It | is already | a hurricane 
It | is | already 80 miles 
it | 's forecast to move | the northeast 
That | is | a pretty quick movement 
it | could be anywhere | the Carolinas 
this thing | is still going | the southwest 
that | is | 100 miles 
That | could be | Tybee 
That | could be | Wrightsville Beach 
That | could be | all the way 
We | have to wait | it 
we | know where | it 
this | is | Ike 
there | is | Friday 
There | is | Saturday 
it | eclipses | Florida 
it | could be | a Cat 2 
there | are still | many unknowns 
it | is | a big open ocean 
no one | sending | weather balloons 
We | do n't know exactly how | the winds 
This | is | just literally 
it | is | a guess 
I | want to ask | you 
What | made | it 
you | had | the mayor 
this | was | the storm of the century 
That | motivated | a lot of people 
There | is | some concern 
I | talked | that 
it | is going to be | the storm of the century 
I | think | it 
really New Orleans | being | the eyewall 
it | was | 35 miles 
that | is | a pretty good forecast 
I | think | the Hurricane Center 
What | caused | that slight turn 
the left | was | a small piece of high pressure 
that | came down | Arkansas 
it | kicked | it 
It | kicked | it 
we | 're going to wake | tomorrow 
we | 're going to see | a lot of damage 
We | 're not maybe going | the mother of all storms 
we | 're going to see | damage 
we | 're not seeing | New Orleans 
we | 're not seeing | Morgan City 
Houma | took | the brunt of this storm 
the bayous , | pushed | water 
It | was called | U.S.-90 
we | do n't have | pictures of that tonight 
We | 're not going | god 
We | have | crews 
Power lines | are | the place 
there | is still | a curfew 
we | 're going to talk | the mayor
