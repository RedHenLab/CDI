tomorrow night's debate | change | >> > MCCAIN 
who | is | the 
who | is | the real Barack Obama 
McCain | asked | the crowd 
who | is | the real Barack Obama guy 
There | is | no doubt 
just | look | the calendar 
John King | joins | us 
I | want to take | a look 
Obama | pulled ahead | McCain 250 
there | 's been | this huge change 
solid | is | change 
deep | is | support 
could tomorrow night | make | a difference 
Tomorrow night | could make | a difference 
John McCain | is running out | opportunities 
We | 've been telling | people 
months | pay | no attention 
this | is | a time 
Barack Obama | has opened | a lead of six , seven 
that | is | the case 
he | is poised | a big electoral college 
He | have | him 
That | means | he 
I | am | the state of Ohio 
he | is | the next president of the United States 
he | can win | a combination of Colorado 
he | could just win | the state of Florida 
John McCain | has to not only win | all of the Bush 
he | has to take | something 
The economic news | has tilted | the map 
McCain | is running out | time 
It | is | that simple 
I | do n't know | they 
the people | saying | they 
they | 're | the poll booths 
they | 're | it 
some guy | taking | a census 
they | know | there 
who | vote | way 
They | do n't think | it 
Barack Obama | has said | this campaign 
I | lose | this election 
it | is | my ideas 
I | did | a good enough idea 
good enough job | putting | my ideas 
it | is | something 
There | are | pockets 
who | may be saying | they 
they | do n't think | it 
these polls | take | account 
The pollsters | are doing | the best 
You | take | account party identification 
You | call | people 
You | say | how many 
You | try to call | young people 
Most of them | have | cell phones 
the pollsters | are trying to admit | this year 
we | have | so many new voters 
it | is | a bit of crapshoot 
That | is why | the margins 
Barack Obama | is leading | a lot of these close battleground states 
that | means | by three or four points 
That | means | there 
time | is running | John McCain 
this | is where | their resource advantage 
John McCain | might deliver | a great attack 
the Democrats | have | more money and more resources 
which | is | a very new dynamic 
A driver | makes | a big mistake 
We | 'll have | the video 
We | 'll explain | what 
O.J. Simpson | facing | possible life 
Our " Crime & Punishment " report | will tell | you 
what | happened | the courtroom
