People | are talking | it 
I | think | there 
that | have been going | throughout 
There | is | the conversation 
that | 's been happening | the pundits 
there | is | the conversation 
that | 's been happening | the ground 
They | 're | the economy 
They | do n't care | the sort of back 
you | hear | a lot 
they | read | anything 
I | think | Michelle Obama 
she | is | an angry black woman 
I | think | she 
People | are | the economy 
I | heard | my show 
there | are | code words 
What code words | do | you 
people | believe | they 
us | take | this whole thing 
he | is | a Muslim 
folks | understand | what 
you | know | what 
who | have | that kind of mentality

you | have | an entire generation 
that | does not want to go back | time 
The New York Times | published | a scathing editorial 
They | have gone far | the usual fare of quotes 
this | is | just standard fare 
What else | do | you 
you | think | The Times 
I | think | The New York Times 
there | have been | very encouraging signs 
he | did not bring out | Bill Ayers 
He | has put | Reverend Wright off-limits 
his top aides | told | Politico 
the he | did not intend to bring up | Bill Ayers 
He | was n't going to go | that road 
he | wanted to keep | Reverend Wright 
The issue | has | what 
That | is where | the real trouble 
it | is | the combination of her rhetoric 
that | have occurred | these rallies 
it | 's not only brought | these 
we | have had | reports 
someone | yelling | out "terrorist 
you | have | people 
people | say | a crowd 
it | is up | to 
it | is up | Sarah Palin 
John McCain | to tell | her 
this | has | no place 
we | do not condone | this 
us | show | more respect 
That | is | a fair point 
I | think | it 
We | are going to talk | more 
I | will get | you 
We | have got to take | a quick commercial break 
Barack Obama | is ahead | most polls 
people | are responding | one 
they | 're | the voting 
We | are digging | deeper 
They | get | another bailout 
They | spent | hundreds of thousands 
Senator Obama | talked | it 
We | found | AIG 
that | got | a bailout 
they | got | help 
I | will tell | you 
the Treasury | should demand | money 
you | recognize | this guy 
you | are paying | his mistakes 
Who | are | the executives 
who | got | us 
Who | is | the blame 
we | are naming | names
