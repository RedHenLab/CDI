That | is | a poster of the rally today 
She | is also | the covers of TIME" and " Newsweek 
you | see | her 
you | look | it 
she | seems to have changed | the complexion of the race 
she | will make | a difference 
she | is certainly | a full-blown celebrity 
what Joe Biden | told | a local reporter 
I | think | the issue 
what | does | Sarah Palin 
I | assume | she 
That comment | was actually made | yesterday 
us | dig | deeper 
We | were talking | this 
I | think | they 
This whole phenomena | has upset | them 
I | think | it 
that | is | sexist 
He | would say | a male candidate 
he | 's saying | it 
a female candidate | is | something 
the Obama people | to not talk | George Bush 
they | 're | these petty fights 
That | 's | a fight 
it | takes | them 
I | think | what 
what's | really grinding | them 
now the headliner | has been | Sarah Palin for 
that | has been | the signature issue 
He | has flown | that 
Obama | leads | the subject of who 
John McCain | is gaining | him 
that | is why | you 
I | do n't think | they 
they | did n't expect | this kind of splash 
they | 're struggling to get | the headlines 
how | to go | her 
There | are | a number of Democrats 
I | do n't know why | Obama 
He | should leave that | Joe Biden 
Obama | ought to get back | the issues 
you | know | what 
This | is | X , Y and Z 
John McCain | is | George Bush 
you | have worked | Democrats and Republicans 
you | advise | the Obama people 
I | think | Candy 
there | is | an odd parallel 
Barack Obama | is now | Hillary Clinton 
that | is | she 
she | thought | she 
She | had worked | all this time 
Everybody | saw | her 
who | was going to get | it 
nowhere | takes | it 
Barack Obama's | worked | two years 
his people | have been | this 
Sarah Palin | comes | nowhere 
they | do n't know | what 
I | think | they 
balance | trying to come | grips 
I | do think | it 
Obama | to put | Sarah Palin 
that | lowers | him 
he | gets | that 
you | say | down 
I | think | it 
the presidential candidate of a party | starts sparring | the vice presidential person 
Candy | made | this point 
it | takes | you 
you | raise | her up 
you | 're fighting | both Palin and McCain 
He | needs to take | on 
He | does not need to get | this Palin stuff 
Let others | do | that 
there | are | press stories 
she | charged | the state government of Alaska 
She | submitted | diem charges 
you | do n't do | that 
you | were talking | Hillary 
I | show | this button 
I | bought | this a couple weeks 
we | say | TV 
you | see | this 
That | was | two weeks 
Sarah Palin | is now | a phenom 
I | think | Hillary Clinton 
I | do n't know | this 
I | think | she 
I | told | you 
the reason | would be | Obama 
a dangerous nominee | is | he 
they | came | him 
he | would be flustered | all of this 
we | 're seeing | it 
I | 'm not saying | he 
they | off | their game 
you | see | Obama 
Hillary Clinton | did | this 
they | get | his head 
you | see | what 
he | 's saying | the stump 
it | is clearly | a product of careful planning 
he | 's doing | he 
he | needs to say | it 
he | ca n't help but say | it 
We | are going to have | a lot
