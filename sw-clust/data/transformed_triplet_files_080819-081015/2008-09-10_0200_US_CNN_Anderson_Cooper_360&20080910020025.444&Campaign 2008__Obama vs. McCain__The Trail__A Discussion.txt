that | could make or break | the candidates 
Senator Obama | is | such a tough sell 
you | heard | the Internet rumors 
You | deserve | nothing 
more new polling tonight | showing | the national race 
a new NBC poll | out tonight reflecting | a one-point Obama lead 
nearly every other recent poll | showing | similar numbers 
the two sides | are narrowing | their focus 
The Straight Talk Express | pulled | a now familiar post-convention scene 
who | waited | hours 
the return of what | had been | a standard attack line 
one McCain | dropped | campaigning 
Senator Obama | was | Iran 
He | was | Iraq 
He | was | Russia 
He | is | America's national security challenges 
he | has | no experience 
he | lacks | the judgment 
A senior adviser | concedes | CNN 
McCain | brought | that line 
It | was | a month 
they | were | all saying , oh 
it | is | experience , experience , experience 
they | chose | Palin 
they | start talking | change 
CNN | is told | camp McCain 
they | 're not abandoning | a core pre-convention 
Obama | lacks | the judgment 
he | 's talked | experience 
the thrust of McCain's theme | is | change 
That | seems to be working | him 
I | was just talking | a senior adviser tonight 
who | said | their internal data shows 
McCain and Palin | have been pushing | this 
undecideds | are seeing | him 
I | will tell | you 
what's interesting | is | they 
it | means not talking | George W. Bush 
McCain today | is | what 
You | know | what 
The president | announced | 8,000 troops 
That | is | something 
you | would think | John McCain 
he | did n't mention | it 
anything | related | Bush 
he | did n't mention | it 
the McCain forces | hitting | experience 
Barack Obama today | turned | a traditionally winning issue 
what | 's been | now a winning issue 
He | set | a minor firestorm 
You | be | the judge 
many ways | can Barack | Obama 
John McCain | is | the candidate of change 
you | can put | lipstick 
( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ) | > | > OBAMA 
It | is still | a pig 
( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ) | > | > BASH 
they | took | that personally 
Sarah Palin | was being compared | a pig 
Obama aides | responded | the response 
a pathetic attempt | to play | the gender card 
McCain | running | an increasingly dishonorable campaign 
the campaign trail | bristles | tension 
Obama | pitched | his education program 
the McCain campaign | put up | an ad 
MCCAIN CAMPAIGN AD | > | > NARRATOR 
Legislation | to teach | comprehensive sex education 
sex | learning to read | ? 
The Obama campaign | called | that ad shameful 
a distortion of a bill | designed to protect | children 
It | was | blistering 
they | want to question | John McCain's honor and record of service 
that | is | a debate 
Candy | joins | us 
a pig comment | was also then immediately followed | another old 
( LAUGHTER ) | > | > CROWLEY 
John McCain | used | the same expression 
I | think | what 
which | is looking | women voters 
They | have been talking | sexism of late 
Sarah Palin | was | sexist 
that | is why | you 
they | 're trying to play | the sexism card 
We | 're also joined now | David Gergen and " TIME" magazine political guru 
you | can say | all 
you | want | John McCain 
it | was still | a foolish thing 
every night | is | him 
terms | getting | his message 
This | is | one night 
his message | got muffled | this silliness 
you | 're shaking | your head 
I | think | this 
the press | just absolutely playing | the McCain campaign's crocodile tears 
They | do n't think | this 
They | know exactly | what 
They | know exactly | what 
It | is | an expression 
this | is | a victory 
they | can make | this a pig fight 
it | is | them 
it | 's reducing | Barack Obama's message 
I | think | this 
( LAUGHTER ) | > | > COOPER 
what | do you make | the McCain campaign's continued use of Sarah Palin's line 
she | supported | it 
she | changed | her position 
she | still took | all the tens of millions 
that | was supposed to go | the bridge 
Alaska ? | > | GERGEN 
I | 'm | they 
they | have got | enormous momentum 
Ohio | has changed | over 
I | 'm surprised | they 
I | 'm surprised | they 
her | speak | the public 
She | 's not taking | public questions 
She | goes | her airplane 
it | is | the record 
You | ca n't quote | her there 
They | have n't talked | the press 
her son | is going | Iraq 
she | going to have | her first press interview 
I | 'm surprised | all of that 
I | tell | you 
I | was | Washington today 
there | are | just a lot of people 
who | are getting | really angry or upset 
I | think | Mark 
There | is | a lot of lowness 
there | been | a vice presidential candidate 
who | has yet to talk | the press 
it | is | another thing 
I | 'm | our profession 
She | should be held | that 
The bridge | to | nowhere thing 
you | press | them 
they | ca n't defend | what 
They | 're staying | it 
It | is | their advertising 
I | 'm not saying | the press 
a core part of their message | is | something 
we | 're not doing | our jobs 
we | just treat | this 
we | 're getting | tons of e-mails 
people | saying | we 
Sarah Palin | looking | her 
polarized people | are | Sarah Palin 
who | are | the national ticket 
We | have got | 60 
60 days | to do | this 
she | does n't cooperate | that more 
We | are going to talk more | Mark and David 
I | 'm blogging | the hour
