she | vetoed | a half-a-billion dollars worth 
She | took | some earmark spending 
John McCain | claiming | Sarah Palin 
us | talk | strategy 
we | 're going to talk | a lot 
all campaigns | stretch | the truth 
I | think | Karl Rove 
This | has gone well | the normal bounds 
you | see are | journalists 
Senator McCain | claims | she 
The Wall Street Journal | has | a big piece today 
The Wall Street Journal | has | a big piece today 
I | think | what 
you | see | various news agency 
they | 're lying | something 
That | is | a campaign 
I | think | this 
they | 're | sort of being 
I | think | there 
a real pushback | starting | the McCain campaign 
one | sensed | it 
I | think | it 
it | is | the public 
John McCain | said | the Associated Press 
Barack Obama | did not call | Sarah Palin 
a pig | saying | the lipstick 
he | approved | this commercial 
I | approve | this commercial " 
they | had | that quote 
I | think | this day 
one of these guys | can take | the American economy 
there | are | these subsidiary questions 
John McCain | is | the campaign 
he | has authorized | his staff 
He | is clearly | uncomfortable 
It | 's | the way 
I | approve | these messages 
I | 'm not saying | he 
we | should forgive | him 
I | think | what 
who | say | he 
his soul | to try to win | the presidency 
I | think | there 
voters | are starting to see | the extreme nature of the degree 
I | think | he 
we | 're going to focus | in-depth tomorrow 
he | made | Sunday 
he | said | both sides 
I | 'm not going to be | the one 
I | think | voters 
Everybody | says | it 
I | can tell | you 
there | are stretched | truth and things 
that | are | fact 
that | show | Barack Obama's speeches 
John McCain | thinks | middle class 
This | is taken | the Saddleback forum 
There | was | a laugh 
me | tell | you 
I | know | people 
I | think | it 
this | is | a routine part of the Obama campaign 
There | has been | a commercial 
John McCain's quotes | were taken out | context 
He | said | January 
he | did n't think | we 
he | was saying | the next couple of paragraphs 
that | does n't take | anything 
This | is | pretty routine stuff 
I | hate to tell | you 
Obama | has also said | he 
the basis | closing | those corporate loopholes 
corporate tax | have | ns 
he | is going to use | the tax increases 
he | 's going to give | people 
who | make | $ 250,000 
there | are | things 
There | are | things 
they | do | both sides 
I | do n't think | it 
I | appreciate why | Candy 
she | can cite | examples 
we | can all cite | examples 
The | lies | the McCain campaigns 
the attempts | to paint | Senator Obama 
they | are | the Obama campaign 
they | drove | the convention 
I | think | Candy 
They | 're taking | themselves 
they | 're trivializing | the prospect 
they | seize | what 
John McCain | said | about $ 5 million 
they | did | today 
they | seize | John McCain 
there | are | fundamental strengths 
he | 's not going to say | there 
they | seize | one mis 
they | have | several times 
I | think | they 
That | 's | what 
It | should n't be | distortions 
it | should n't be | what 
every | try to make | the campaign 
the McCain campaign | responding | the Obama campaign 
what's | been occurring | the last couple weeks 
which | is | the Obama campaign kind 
McCain | > | GERGEN 
I | think | that 
There | 's going to be | a lot backing-and-forthing 
I | think | the central story of today 
us | go back | what 
we | have reached | another major turning point 
John McCain | had | all the momentum 
There | was | a resistance 
what | happened | the weekend 
the bottom | falling | the financial markets 
we | have been saying | some time 
this | is | the worst financial crisis 
Alan Greenspan | said | Sunday 
it | seems | me 
there | is | a real turning point 
there | is | the opportunity 
Obama | to seize | the momentum 
I | do n't know | he 
McCain | has | an opportunity 
there | is | no question 
that | is | what 
that | is | what 
He | 's now got | the opportunity 
he | 's got | the critique 
he | has n't provided | a message 
he | surrounded | himself 
I | think | he 
it | played | a big role 
it | 's going to be | center 
foreclosures | were showing | on B-17 
this | is | what 
the economy | is | one of their strengths 
they | can paint | John McCain
