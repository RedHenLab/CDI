There | must be | a path 
taxpayers | to recover | the money 
that | is put | this fund 
One trillion dollars | is | an unprecedented sum 
that money | ca n't simply go | a black hole of bad debt 
no means | recovering | any of the funds 
We | can ask | taxpayers 
we | cannot ask | them 
you | see | the breaking news banner 
Senators Obama and McCain | today | each demanding oversight 
Both | are still promising to cut | taxes 
Ali | showed | us 
we | can have | it 
us | talk | strategy 
It | seems | the proposals 
the days | having | all these policies 
they | have been promising | us 
that | seems | the window 
They | add | more deficits 
we | 're learning | this 
what | is | out 
who | used to run | the Government Accounting Office 
what | is happening | Washington 
We | 're getting | way 
we | will have | a crisis 
we | do n't clean | it 
I | think | it 
the candidates | to get | much more serious 
I | think | they 
They | are not going to be | able 
The next president | is going to be mired | this issue of debt 
you | have been | Washington 
today | talking | folks 
everyone | seems to agree | they 
we | 're hearing | Capitol Hill 
you | have | people 
I | do n't think | I 
You | have | people 
we | need | this 
There | 's even been | some voices today 
things | seemed to have calmed | just a bit 
we | need | this right 
you | have | economists 
I | was also talking | voters 
I | had somebody say | me 
I | 'm | Wall Street 
I | 'm | global warming 
I | 'm | health care reform 
I | have to explain | things 
which | is | all of this 
We | may not have | money 
it | is | the world 
we | 're not hearing | that 
both candidates | announcing | conditions 
they | want included | the bailout 
this point | voting | the bailout 
I | saw | John McCain's press conference 
He | was asked | point-blank 
he | basically kind | of 
Barack Obama | kicked | it 
I | go back | Secretary Paulson 
neither one of them | would say | they 
it | did n't have | these principles 
which | run | the same lines of limiting CEO buyout pay 
there | is | something 
they | were | there 
they | have are | these economists 
You | need to do | something 
they | have | Main Street 
the push | to have | individuals 
You | do n't hear | it 
they | are going to pass | a bill 
They | have | no choice 
They | know | they 
Wall Street | will tell | you 
it | will happen | this week 
I | think | it 
I | 'm | it 
they | are going to pass | a bill 
Warren Buffet | came | with $ 5 billion today 
he | is investing | Goldman Sachs 
which | was | a really positive signal 
I | think | it 
you | have got | a good handle 
the rising anger one | feels now | the public 
there | was | shock and fear 
they | think | they 
who | do n't deserve | this 
they | ca n't pay | their mortgages 
I | do n't know how | that 
both candidates | are trying | harness 
they | 're | both pushing sort of populist positions 
they | recognize | people voters 
I | was | California 
just the other day | talking | some struggling people 
who | may have to in | fact 
they | can do | some basic math 
$ 700 billion | works out to be | about $ 2,300 
I | have | three kids 
$ 11,500 | is | kind of what 
I | did | some math 
That | is | 55 gallons of gasolines 
That | is | big , big money 
the government | using | this kind of money 
movement | helping | regular families 
It | makes | people 
they | can come | with $ 700 billion 
they | have talked | health care 
they | have talked | crumbling infrastructure 
they | have talked | a crisis 
there | is | no money 
there | is | $ 700 billion 
this | is | $ 700 billion 
them | out | their mistakes 
these toxic assets | are there | part 
there | was | some misdeeds 
we | have also got to be | we 
I | think | we 
we | got | this 
a lot of people | could n't afford | houses 
they | could n't afford | the down payments 
they | were | trouble 
you | restore | good jobs 
middle-income Americans | can | fact 
that | is | as much 
I | do n't think | it 
us | to say | it 
who | got | us 
I | think | it 
it | 's supposed to be | foreign policy 
it | 's not going to be | foreign policy 
they | 're just going to talk | the economy 
you | 're | the midst of this nightmare 
there | are | many ways 
you | 're | Barack Obama 
we | have paid | this war 
that | has gone | nearly six years 
we | could be using | this 
I | do n't think | there 
you | do n't talk | that 
We | are going to have to leave | it 
We | would love to have | you 
I | 'm | a big fan 
I | 'm | a big fan of yours
