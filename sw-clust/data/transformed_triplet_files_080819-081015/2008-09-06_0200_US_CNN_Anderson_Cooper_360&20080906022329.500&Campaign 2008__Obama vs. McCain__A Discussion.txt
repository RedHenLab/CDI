I | was around | Harry Truman 
( LAUGHTER ) | > | > BIDEN 
I | remember | my grandfather 
they | yelled | Harry Truman 
I | 'm not going to give | them 
I | 'm going to tell | them 
they | 're going to think | it 
( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ) | > | > COOPER 
The Obama campaign | is clearly hoping | Biden 
the battlefield | has shifted | the addition of Sarah Palin 
I | was talking | Ed 
who | was saying | he 
you | see | the race 
we | hear now | Hillary Clinton 
she | now going to have | a much more prominent role 
I | think | she 
I | think | media focus 
they | 're going to be | what 
I | think | she 
she | will get | more coverage 
she | 's made | it 
she | 's not going to take | on Sarah Palin 
She | will go | John McCain 
she | thinks | he 
I | think | the bigger issue 
what | 's going to be happening | the world 
the candidates | have to come | grips 
We | 're back | where 
we | were | the conventions 
I | think | the big question 
who | can do | the best job 
that | are communicated | a way 
that | make them believable | they 
the Republicans | had | a convention 
that | was | personalities 
that | has given | Obama 
I | do n't think | he 
Ronald Reagan | developed | a message 
the country | knew | what 
It | helped to bring | him 
who | played | a key role 
I | do n't think | Barack Obama 
He | needs | more surrogates 
he | needs | a sharper , stronger , more compelling economic message 
you | were overseeing | Sarah Palin 
you | allow | her 
( LAUGHTER ) | > | > ROLLINS 
there | been | a Republican candidate 
who | has yet to actually talk | reporters 
There | are plenty | candidates 
who | have been hidden | both sides of the aisle 
That | 's | the 
that | 's | the issue 
I | think | the issue 
David | said | it 
They | work | a year 
This | is | the economic night 
This | is | national security 
This | became | a personality contest 
We | came | the convention 
everybody sort of watched | to see | she 
she | gave | an energy 
we | came | a personality 
who | did not give | a great speech 
he | became somewhat | a personality 
more people | watched | him 
I | think | we 
you | have | two personalities 
Neither | have defined | themselves 
no one | knows | yet who 
who | can take | the country 
it | remains | a personality contest 
Barack Obama | have | a better chance of losing 
this | becomes | a referendum 
I | do n't know | I 
He | 's got | remarkable appeal 
it | 's simply | personality 
It | is | message 
It | 's | a laundry list 
my party | is | the party of 12-point plans 
( LAUGHTER ) | > | > BEGALA 
it | is | a message 
what David Gergen | talked | President Reagan 
you | were | four years 
who | hammered | that economy 
I | think | David's right 
he | 's going to generate | new jobs and growth 
this | is | a 60-day battle day 
who | won | the day 
McCain | won | the day today 
Barack and Biden | lost | the day 
I | think | they 
they | did n't seem | sharp and tough 
I | would like | them 
Tara Wall | > | WALL 
this | is why | Barack Obama 
It | is why | he 
all | love | him 
all | love listening | him 
he | 's talking | this big government 
a way | to pay | it 
voters | have | a problem 
those | are | the issues 
You | talk | messaging 
they | work | time 
OK | > | WALL 
There | is still | substance 
They | 're hearing | him 
They | 're starting to hear | more of him 
they | 're not liking | what 
he | 's got to really be | the specifics 
I | heard | you 
we | heard | today 
him | talking | about a 6.1 percent unemployment rate 
you | need | the message 
we | have got | the worst unemployment 
I | 'm going to do | it 
you | get | that sound bite 
you | get | both
