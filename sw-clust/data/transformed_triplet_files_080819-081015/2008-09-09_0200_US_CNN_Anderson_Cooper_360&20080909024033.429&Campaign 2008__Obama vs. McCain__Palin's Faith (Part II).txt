It | was | a visiting pastor 
who | made | the >> > COOPER 
Governor Sarah Palin | speaking out | the pulpit 
we | examined | the church 
we | continue | our look 
her beliefs | how | her 
faith | may or may not play | a role 
CNN's Randi Kaye | digging | this exclusive report 
Sarah Palin | was | a practicing Pentecostal 
the McCain campaign | says | Palin 
She | has n't talked | her faith 
she | playing | her Pentecostal roots 
I | think | there 
that | could be misunderstood or played | by 
that | do n't know | what 
God | is | the creator of the world 
he | can be accessed | simple conversation and prayer 
he | has | the highest plans and purposes 
Palin | left | the church 
six years | to join | a more mainstream nondenominational church 
camera ) | ( | We 
she | left | the church 
we | do know | the senior pastor 
Alaska | is destined to serve | a shelter 
I | believe | Alaska 
Many Pentecostals | believe | we 
Jesus | will return only | believers 
God | has | a destiny 
Pastor Ed Cowman ( ph ) | focused | presidential candidate John Kerry 
he | questioned | the salvation 
who | voted | the Democrat 
The church | directed | us 
the pastor | was joking when | he 
Kerry supporters | would go | hell 
We | do acknowledge | hindsight 
we | do apologize | that 
This statement | is not written | a defense 
Israel | were | God's judgment of Jews 
who | have n't embraced | Christianity 
we | see | it 
East Jerusalem | took | a bulldozer 
you | ca n't miss | it 
camera ) ( on Would David Brickner be invited to speak here again after | making | those comments 
The McCain campaign | has confirmed | Palin 
Palin's spokeswoman | told | me 
Brickner's comments | are | a reflection of her views 
I | know | the governor 
a doubt | is | Israel 
Pastor Larry Kroon | would n't comment | Palin's beliefs 
you | think | a person's faith 
You | 're talking | a real core aspect of who 
they | are how | they 
I | think | that 
they | 'll make | decisions 
Randy | joins | us 
I | guess | the real question 
Sarah Palin | make | decisions 
she | does become | vice president 
she | did not push | her socially-conservative agenda 
some of the Democrats | say | that 
she | was too tied | the oil industry 
she | does n't make | it 
she | will turn | her attention 
What | 's been | the McCain campaign response 
all the YouTube videos | coming out | Sarah Palin's church 
It | has n't been | it 
They | released | a statement 
she | has saying | the war 
She | is not asserting | it 
an incredibly humble statement | saying | the campaign
