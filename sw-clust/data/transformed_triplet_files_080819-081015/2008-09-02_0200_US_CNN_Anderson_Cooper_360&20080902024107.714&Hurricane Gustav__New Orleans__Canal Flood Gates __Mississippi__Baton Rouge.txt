We | got | word 
they | have just closed | a flood gate 
we | were there | Friday 
They | keep | water 
Lake Pontchartrain | rushing | the canal and flooding 
You | 're looking | them 
The gates | take | about 45 minutes 
The Corps | says | it 
Sean Callebs | has | more 
this | is | an important step 
This | is | something 
you | remember | the giant breaches 
that | happened | the blood walls 
that | led | 80 percent of the city 
a lot of it | can be traced back | both 
they | had | about a 200-foot breach 
the water | is pushed down | Lake Pontchartrain 
it | flows back | the opposite way of the canal 
it | eats away | the soil 
they | put | these flood 
water | going back | the canal 
This | is | the first time 
they | 've had to close | the floodgates 
they | put | these floodgates 
now two of the three canals | have had | the floodgates 
They | say | this 
It | 's working | the way 
it | could be | a different story 
We | 're going to have to watch | what 
it | can often take | that long before 
we | see | the full impact of the storm 
us | remember | a lot of this soil 
we | 're talking | earth 
these | are | areas 
that | are just completely saturated | this point 
the Corps | calls scouring | that area 
they | 're going to have to keep | an eye 
This | is | something 
They | 're going to have | these concerns 
I | guess | the real story 
they | spent | so much time 
Engineers | threw | blueprints 
they | could do | this 
This | had never been done | these kind of floodgates 
they | want to have | these floodgates 
this | is | a problem 
that | has haunted | New Orleans 
it | 's been | the map 
you | 've been covering | it 
We | want to take | you 
Gustav | has battered | the coast 
National Hurricane Center | says | the storm surge 
Waveland | reached | 11 feet earlier today 
CNN's Kathleen Koch | is | 10 miles 
what | is | the latest there 
I | do n't think | you 
they | dodged | a bullet 
They | were clearly grazed | it 
it | did draw | some blood 
a ferocious storm surge | wreaked | havoc 
all eight casinos | shut | Highway 90 
Tropical-storm-force winds | pushed | a massive tree 
Neighbors | lost | power 
They | can have | it 
We | can send | it 
the winds | ripped | roofs 
The wall of another building | collapsed | the street 
Police | tried to clear | potential projectiles 
National Guard | convoys patrolled | the streets 
Governor Haley Barbour | said | keeping order 
we | have deployed | so much armed , uniformed manpower 
utility crews | wrestled | tree limbs 
the storm surge | devoured | the small craft harbor 
some boats | tossing | others 
Two million dollars of federal , state and local funds | have been spent repairing | it 
oyster season | was supposed to start | today 
This thing | is really going to affect | a lot of jobs 
people | stuff | that 
they | should be going | work 
there | is | a lot of people 
Waveland | were cut | off 
I | did check | the good mayor 
they | say | they 
They | 've got | some wind damage 
They | 've got | flooding 
they | say | they 
They | 're just hoping | the roads 
We | 'll check | you 
almost 2 million men , women and kids | left | their homes 
360's Randi Kaye | is | an evacuee

Baton Rouge | was pounded | this afternoon 
There | was | a pretty good storm surge 
there | have n't been | any deaths

There | was | some flooding 
It | is | a little bit 
there | are | thousands of evacuees

Many people | just looking | a good night's rest 
New Orleans | are actually | shelters 
Many of them | are staying | hotels 
we | 're joined | a couple of them 
you | are staying | the hotel 
You | did not evacuate | Katrina 
you | decided to evacuate | this time 
we | decided to leave | a family 
you | were | town 
you | went to work | your mom 
What | was | that like 
> > | DONNIE | ARSENEAUX 
we | lost power | the first day 
This | was | one of the hospitals 
they | did n't have | any air conditioning 
we | had | patients 
you | had | any reports 
There | is | some power 
There | is | some power 
We | know | there 
you | compare | this storm 
I | 'm | New Orleans 
I | 'm | work 
There | 's | the storm surge 
we | thought | there 
which | is why | there 
you | were supposed to actually start | school 
Thursday | even get | your braces 
that | 's going to happen | you 
I | know | you 
This | is | your fifth hurricane

It | started | 8 p.m. tonight 
I | 'm told | nobody 
We | 'll talk | Mayor Nagin 
New Orleans | heeded | the warnings 
Their refusal | to move | rescue workers 
their lives | to try to save | other lives 
360 M.D. Dr. Sanjay Gupta | spent | the day 
What | did | you 
It | is | a double-edged sword 
they | 're being told to evacuate | everyone else 
risk | to take | care of people 
I | think | what 
they | said | it 
they | got | the no-go call 
they | could n't go out | the winds 
who | were trapped | their cars 
the levees | to see | anybody 
people | were calling | in 
911 | > | GUPTA 
There | were | calls 
they | would go | those calls 
they | got | the specific no-go command 
that | was only | about a half 
we | visited | that area 
What | is | the biggest danger 
the hospitals | > | GUPTA 
I | think | this time period 
you | expect | all the wind 
there | would be | a lot of problems 
it | is | the hours and days 
People | start to go back | their homes 
They | have | damage and stuff 
they | go | a hospital 
People | falling | the roofs 
it | ends up being | things 
You | do n't get as much | the debris 
there | was | so few people 
it | was | some of these house 
They | did | a pretty good job 
I | was | here three years 
I | 'll never forget | your work 
We | 're going to talk | Sanjay 
he | saw | today
