We | 'll try to find | the answer 
That | is | how much investors 
a retirement plan | lost | today 
That | is | what 
$ 1.2 trillion | gone | just 6 hours 
The stock market | losing | $ 3 billion 
the markets | reopened | 
we | 're watching | markets 
we | 'll continue to follow | that 
they | are pointing | fingers 
They | 're fiddling | your money burns 
The financial rescue package | devised | the administration 
the weekend | failed to pass | the House 
You | know | that 
Two-thirds of the House Democrats | voted yes and about | two-thirds Republicans 
we | 'll tell | you 
We | begin | Jessica Yellin 
all | broke | the bipartisan bailout 
67 percent of the republican Congress | decided to put | political ideology 
I | think | this 
Speaker Pelosi | to listen not only | her members 
the debate | began | this morning 
the so-called financial rescue legislation | was | a bitter pill 
who | supported | it 
This | will be | the most difficult decision 
I | make | my 16 years 
I | have decided | the cost 
I | can describe | it 
all | know | it 
Members | would rather not be here | this 
Republican leaders | were | they 
the pressure | would pull | their members 
We | did think | we 
a dozen more votes | going | the floor 
we | thought | we 
the Republicans | said | Speaker Pelosi 
They | claim to be | free market advocates 
it | is really | an anything 
Right | is | this reason 
I | believe | this vote 
This | is | Speaker Pelosi's speech 
frankly | was | this discussion 
Democrats | called | that ridiculous 
There | were | 12 Republican members 
I | 'll make | an offer 
I | will go talk uncharacteristically nicely | them 
they | are maybe | they 
Those | were | the only laughs today 
leaders | are trying to figure | how 
they | return | Thursday 
You | say when | they 
they | have left | town 
They | 're | what 
you | think | it 
it | is | kind of unbelievable 
this | is how | it 
They | thought | deadline 
The Senate | is still | business tomorrow 
they | do n't expect | the Senate 
the Dow | was tanking | they 
There | were | members 
the floor | saying | it 
we | 're told | some of them 
they | were | what 
they | said | 12 members or so 
they | switched | their vote 
they | named | names 
They | wo n't tell | us 
they | 're telling | us 
there | were | a number of people 
who | were feeling | they 
yes | were upset | the partisan tone 
they | call | the partisan tone of the debate 
the Democrats | have been describing | this 
they | were | they 
they | say | Pelosi 
that | did | it 
it | does seem | they 
they | did n't even know | they 
It | does seem | a stretch 
Nancy Pelosi | made them vote | the biggest bailout 
It | is | a tough vote 
staffers | reporting | that e-mails and calls 
There | 's | a bit of doubt 
analyst | blogger | Nate Silver ( ph ) 
Lawmakers | split | safe congressional districts 
the highly contested races | voted no | more than 3-1 
the most voted | not voted | the bailout 
both | supported | the bill 
McCain | took | credit 
each | is trying to use | its failure 
> > | ED | HENRY 
I | was | the improved rescue plan 
the house floor | is | a stinging defeat 
who | raised | the stakes 
he | 'd suspend | his campaign 
the Dow | plunged | 778 points 
McCain | was | the defensive 
he | tried to pin | the defeat 
McCain | insisted | he 
Congress | infused | unnecessary partisanship 
the time | to fix | the blame 
it | is | time 
McCain | is | his best lobbying efforts 
133 fellow Republicans | voted | no 
some conservatives | are charging | McCain 
I | think | John McCain 
He | should be right there pushing | the principals and conservatives 
The bailout | is | one of the few major issues 
Obama | is | line 
Both men | have suggested | they 
many House conservatives | rejecting | both 
their presidential nominee | has given | Obama 
an opportunity | to tie | McCain 
This crisis | is | a direct result of a philosophy 
who | have been running | Washington 
McCain allies | continue to insist | he 
the right move | inserting | himself 
95 Democrats | voted | the bill 
He | wanted to come back | Washington 
it | is | the Democrats 
they | 're | the ones 
who | run | Congress 
the challenge | is | McCain 
who | was | the financial crisis 
47 percent | said | Republicans 
24 percent | said | democrats 
I | think | that 
what | 's making | the crisis 
The Treasury Secretary today | say | look 
we | have to find | some sort of plan 
He | is | the guy 
who | is | charge of the administration 
he | does n't seem to know | what 
the candidates | are | sort of trading swipes 
neither one of them | has really laid | a plan 
that | 's going to fix | it 
they | were | both kind of dancing 
I | think | the American people 
they | are seeing | our political systems 
They | thought | there 
that | could be solved when | the rank and file members 
people | are seeing | all these chaos 
they | 're not seeing | a solution 
That | is | what 
The president | is speaking | tomorrow morning 
We | 're going to carry | it 
other meetings | scheduled | tomorrow 
I | know | a lot of these congressmen 
Washington | to try to figure | what 
You | would think | they 
We | 're not hearing | a lot of congressional meetings 
I | pressed | various leaders of both parties 
What | is | the next step 
They | did n't have | you 
we | 're going to meet here | tomorrow 
they | were saying | look officials 
This | is | about the eighth or ninth time 
he | spoke | the last ten days 
the same megaphone | say | the same thing 
there | are | a lot of politics 
We | 'll talk | David Gergen 
Suze Orman | is | us 
you | can ride | the storm 
you | have | some questions 
It | is | all the way 
I | 'll try to ask | some of your questions 
We | have | a live web cast 
she | 'll be | part of that as well 
Sarah Palin | talking again | Katie Couric 
We | 'll show | you
