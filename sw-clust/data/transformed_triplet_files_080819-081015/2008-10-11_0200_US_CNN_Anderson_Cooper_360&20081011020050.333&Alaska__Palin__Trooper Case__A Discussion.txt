the government | announced | a short time 
This | is | a very big deal 
We | 're going to have | extensive coverage 
we | have breaking | news 
State lawmakers | have determined | just a short time 
Sarah Palin | abused | her power 
the firing of her former public safety commissioner | violated | state ethics law 
they | found | she 
It | is | a somewhat confusing report 
Randi Kaye | has been reading | it 
Hard | to make | sense of it 
It | is | about 250 pages or so 
an investigator | found | Sarah Palin 
governor | violated | a state ethics law 
He | was | an Alaska State Trooper 
the findings | show | Governor Palin 
state employees | to fire | Trooper Wooten 
Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan | was fired | Palin 
the report | found | his refusal 
the report | said | Palin 
her rights | did not break | the law 
the report | found | she 
the law | pressuring | him 
she | did violate | the trust of her office 
Governor Palin | knowingly permitted | a situation 
impermissible pressure | was placed | several subordinates 
The report | concludes | Palin's claims of fear 
not bona fide | were offered to provide | cover 
That | is how | the investigators 
Palin | violated | the ethics act 
This all | began | three years 
The governor | says | Wooten 
he | would kill | her father 
I | did n't threaten | him 
I | have never threatened | anyone 
Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan | was fired | because budgetary decisions 
That and more | was repeated | doctors 
the McCain campaign's attempt | to head | the Legislative Council's findings 
Monegan's dismissal | was | a result of his insubordination and budgetary clashes 
I | believe | I 
I | did not fire | Mike Wooten 
I | believe | I 
I | did not fire | Mike Wooten 
Monegan | told | CNN 
he | was never directly told to fire | Trooper Wooten 
Palin | has conceded | her staff 
she | did not pressure | anyone 
Palin | told | ABC 
him | to fire | Wooten 
who | was making | threats 
Todd Palin | met | Monegan 
she | became | governor 
it | is surely | an embarrassing distraction 
He | was subpoenaed | the investigation 
the report | says | Todd Palin 
He | answered | investigators 
The legislation | has allocated | over $ 100,000 of public money 
I | had | legitimate concerns 
this | will mean | Sarah Palin 
it | be | a line 
her | resume | or much more 
we | 're going to talk | our panel 
the campaign | said | a statement 
Today's report | showed | the governor 
The report | illustrates | what 
we | 've known | all along 
This | was | a partisan led inquiry 
the Palins | were completely justified | their concern 
evidence | to support | the original Monegan allegation 
a tortured argument | to find | fault 
the Personnel Board | continuing | her conversation 
the American people | regarding | the important issues 
us | bring | our political panel 
who | has reported extensively | Alaska 
what | do you make | about this 
( LAUGHTER ) | > | > DAVID GERGEN 
There | is | something 
It | does | point 
I | think | Randi Kaye 
This | is | an embarrassing distraction 
It | is | the bombshell 
some | thought | it 
she | did n't violate | any laws 
she | fired | this commissioner 
there | is also | plenty of ammunition 
she | did abuse | her power 
Todd Palin | seemed to be | a little 
He | had | a personal obsession 
it | has | much impact 
It | is | a setback 
It | blunts | some of their argument 
they | have been arguing now | the last several days 
Barack Obama | has n't been | Bill Ayers 
what | happened | way 
It | is | the fact 
we | have | a situation 
what | happened here | what 
what | 's been discovered | this commission 
Sarah Palin | said | she 
she | started running | V.P. 
> > | ED | ROLLINS 
it | became | a political issue 
there | is | a line 
I | want to read to make | I 
Governor Palin at | least | official action 
I | have spent | 25 years 
( LAUGHTER ) | > | > ROLLINS 
that | is | a whole 
we | 're | all going 
there | is | another line 
Governor Palin | knowingly permitted | a situation 
impermissible pressure | was placed | several subordinates 
Todd Palin | was making | a lot of calls 
her husband | did make | a lot of calls 
he | asked | me 
she | has | a right 
It | 's going to be | the voters 
It | 's not going to affect | this campaign 
It | will be | a day or two distraction 
We | 're back | the economy 
we | 're back | a debate 
it | is | kind of the perfect fodder 
you | can read | it 
you | can see | it 
you | can see | it 
this | is | a partisan issue 
that | is | exactly what 
there | 's also been | a long defense of hers 
she | said | the man 
she | fired essentially was engaged | insubordination 
He | would n't go | her budget priorities 
There | were | a lot of different reasons 
she | felt | she 
the McCain campaign | has pretty much said | all along 
this | is | all 
we | are | a political season 
that | is | one of those reasons 
it | is also | this legislative body 
they | do n't really buy | the reasons 
they | did n't think | the threats 
this | was | kind of a personal thing 
It | was | their father 
this | is | a bad character 
He | 's had | drunk driving 
I | think | the bottom line 
you | serve | the discretion of the governor 
She | did n't violate | any laws 
she | control | her husband 
I | have worked | a lot of presidents 
they | did n't control | the first ladies 
I | can be | witness 
I | think | the bottom line 
me | ask | you 
that | has been made | Bill Ayers 
Obama | has n't been | his relationship 
you | ca n't trust | him 
that | can now be made | Sarah Palin 
They | will make | it 
she | is | a polarizing figure 
There | is | a lot of people 
who | love | her 
They | will see | this 
just political hey | being made | the other side 
There | are | those 
who | ca n't stand | her 
they | will just add | this 
she | is also | a hard-nosed governor 
People | know | that 
She | tries to get | what 
She | does | what 
that | is | the definition of governor 
People | can read | it 
We | will have | it 
Want | to hear | your thoughts 
I | are going to be blogging | the hour 
there | is | time
