the massive plan | to rescue | the American financial system 
the White House | reportedly sending | top lawmakers 
the Federal Reserve chairman | said | the system 
all the bad debt | hanging | the U.S. economy 
> | > | GEORGE W. BUSH 
America's economy | is facing | unprecedented challenges 
we | 're responding | unprecedented action 
The news | sent | markets 
it | was | this week's meltdown 
AIG | lent | $ 85 billion 
$ 180 billion | pumped | global markets 
we | do not yet know | the details of what 
it | will be | the short term 
that | is | another question 
CNN's Ali Velshi | is working | the story 
He | joins | us 
This plan | being sent | Capitol Hill 
what | do we know | it 
Last night | was | the setup 
That | was | Henry Paulson 
this | is where | we 
we | had reported | this last night 
we | 're up | it 
that plan | has gone | the White House 
they | 're going to work | the weekend 
We | could have | a plan 
they | 're trying to save | a financial services firm 
they | are going to try and figure | out 
that | is going to take | all that bad debt 
a storm | washes | it 
we | 're going to start | there 
We | have got | other analysts 
we | do n't have | this money 
The Federal Reserve | does n't even have | enough money 
it | 's going to be | hundreds of billions 
Henry Paulson | said | today 
they | 're just going | print 
they | are going to have to issue | bonds 
those bonds | get | money 
That | is | what 
we | call printing | money 
we | 're | the woods 
we | 're really | the woods 
the market | reacted | the way 
it | did | several reasons 
There | were | several factors 
that | caused | that market 
I | do n't think | we 
We | need to see | what 
I | think | people 
we | may have averted | absolute disaster 
we | 're not going to see | more jobs 
We | 're not going to see | housing prices 
we | might see | stocks 
this | is | a backstop 
This | stopped | us 
It | has not put | us 
I | want to bring in | some other analysts 
He | is | a financial adviser and presidential 
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson | said | the government 
he | explained | it 
I | am convinced | this bold approach 
American families | far less | the alternative 
frozen credit markets | to fund | economic expansion 
You | say | he 
this | is | the guy 
that | said | subprime 
This | is | the guy 
he | launched | a nuclear warhead 
you | have to remember | the government 
that | infected | the economy 
this government cure | is going to kill | us 
Alan Greenspan | lowered | interest rates 
he | force-fed | all this cheap money 
It | is | because the Fed 
we | had | all these teaser rates 
It | is | because the Fed 
we | had | a housing bubble 
you | 're saying | this bailout 
what now | > | SCHIFF 
it | 's going to make | the situation 
We | 're not eliminating | these losses 
a discussion | taking | a bank 
the Federal Reserve | have to... ( | CROSSTALK) > > VELSHI 
They | loaned | trillions of dollars 
who | ca n't pay | it 
We | 're going to have | failure 
We | will have | a recession 
that | will be | what 
we | would have had | a more severe recession 
we | would n't have had | these problems 
They | did n't want | that recession 
they | pushed off | the problems 
we | 're getting | the problems 
you | have | the politicians 
they | can only see as far | the next election 
They | do n't care | how much long-term damage 
This | is going to destroy | the value of our currency 
I | want to bring in | John Fund 
Fed Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke | told | congressional leaders 
the financial system | is maybe | days 
the alternative | was ? > | JOHN FUND 
I | think | it 
I | agree | Peter 
I | say | I 
you | have to quell | the panic 
the panic | is probably | a little bit excessive 
2.7 percent of mortgages | are | foreclosure 
the rate | was | 20 times 
I | think | what 
we | did | the savings and loan mess 
There | will be | inflation 
we | bundled | all of the assets 
We | cleaned | them 
We | can get | this 
almost every member of Congress | is up | election 
nothing | take | even the smallest risk 
we | were heading | a financial precipice 
I | do n't think | we 
this | is | a political decision 
it | to make | a economic decisions 
the Homeland Security Department | created | the midst of a political crisis 
they | get | more power 
We | got | the withholding tax 
We | won | the war 
we | have | the tax 
the government | cedes | this power 
this | is | an economic crisis 
Our economy | is | a mess 
the Reconstruction Finance Corporation | lasted | seven years 
It | went | business 
It | did | its work 
We | did get rid | it 
There | is | precedent 
we | have | programs 
that | were enacted | the Great Depression 
We | did | the job 
I | do n't trust | it 
this | is | an economic crisis 
There | was | something 
that | was | was today 
we | got here | we 
we | regulate | it 
the future | is | a remarkable debate 
It | is | the debate 
we | have to solve | it 
it | is | no solution 
we | have | people 
We | have | homes 
we | 're dealing | the systems 
The disease | is | our economy 
We | 're borrowing | a bunch of money 
That | 's | a viable economy 
You | 're saying | that 
We | have to do | the opposite 
I | think | you 
This | is | a backstop 
we | do need | a backstop 
Americans | ... | CROSSTALK) > > COOPER 
We | 're borrowing | money 
We | 're borrowing | China 
We | 're borrowing | other countries 
we | 're going to come | another trillion dollars 
foreign governments | are still | the United States 
The dollar | has strengthened | the last few weeks 
we | can get | this 
The stock market | recovered | today 
That | shows | short-term confidence 
That | means | the panic 
We | can get | this 
I | wish | we 
That | is | what 
they | 're facing | voters 
we | 're | recession 
We | have had | two quarters of economic growth 
we | would be | recession 
That | is | the government 
There | is | nobody 
who | is left | America 
We | 're | a deep recession 
The government | is assuming | annual inflation 
That | is how | they 
We | 're | a bad recession 
the Federal Reserve | should not be | the business 
people | taking | bad assets 
It | should be put | the 
They | are going to handle | it 
We | got | this 
We | 're also | a bigger economy 
I | know | you 
I | am | economic matters 
what | is | good 
what | happened | today 
it | sets | massive government intervention 
the Europeans | handle centralized | economic decisions 
we | have stopped | the panic 
the country | are feeling | a sense of relief 
there | is | light 
we | 're going to start sorting | the assets 
We | 're going to try to find | how big 
we | will get | the election 
the election | is | the biggest peril 
this | > | SCHIFF 
This | is | a disaster 
the government | is telling | us 
they | 're preserving | our savings 
They | are going to loot | our deposits 
you | will pull | your money 
They | 're going to turn | the dollar 
You | 're saying even | a bank 
which | is federally insured | $ 100,000 
You | get | your money 
you | lose | the value of your money 
we | have had | the dollar 
that | is | pretty scary advice 
There | is | validity 
you | keep printing | money 
you | dilute | the value of the money 
These | are | important discussions 
we | do have | a crisis 
We | do not have | a fundamentally sound economy 
We | need | the government 
that | is | the case 
we | need to have | a plan 
somebody | has got | a better plan 
that | is | its way 
the time | to talk | it 
we | 're going to have to leave | it

it | is | ( INAUDIBLE ) 
It | is also | International Talk 
I | 'm | what 
he | landing | any blows 
Her nomination | caused | a sensation 
it | 's translating | votes
