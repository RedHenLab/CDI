the ayes | are | 74 
the nays | are | 25 
the bill | having obtained | 60 votes 
That | is | the breaking news 
It | is | a breaking story 
The House | expected to vote | Friday 
that | is | no guarantee 
I | was literally having | flashbacks 
we | saw | senators 
each other | taking | action 
I | can just imagine | folks 
more and more mad | listening | these people 
no one | seems to be | taking responsibility 
you | know | what 
I | had | a role 
I | helped allow | this 
it | break | the next couple of weeks 
We | 've just been looking | those polls 
it | 's breaking | favor of Obama 
either candidate | have | more 
this | > | DAVID GERGEN 
Both men | have | a lot 
the House | votes | it 
John McCain | will pay | a huge price 
the Democrats | peel away | they 
Barack Obama | is going to pay | a big price 
Each man | has | a lot 
they | get | it 
we | 've taken | care of it 
$ 100 billion of extra benefits | have now been added | this bill 
That | is going to drive | next year's deficit 
We | 're going to go | next year 
an eye | popping | $ 600 billion 
you | know | worst deficit 
That extra $ 100 billion | is | the defeat of the bill 
they | ought to be held | the voters 
It | does n't seem to -- | count 
the bailout | to get | it 
they | had | kind of load 
it | up | a little bit 
they | could get | it 
I | do n't think | either presidential candidate 
they | have to go back | the campaign trail 
they | are going to be | the ones 
people | do n't trust | government 
Bill Clinton | made | his first campaign appearance 
I | want to play | just some of what 
he | spoke | for 
He | says | he 
a difference | can he make | a state 
? | > | JOHN KING 
Obama | has to win | this election 
us | talk | the state of Florida 
he | focused | there 
He | said | you 
They | have | a better plan 
This | might not look | you 
This | is | eight years 
This | is | 1996 
Florida | was | none 
he | did | it 
He | ran up | big numbers 
you | have | a lot of Jewish voters 
Democrats | need to run | big numbers 
what Bill Clinton | did | no Democrat 
This | is where | the independents 
this | is where | the largest population center 
he | can | campaign 
he | has | strong support 
That | is | a problem 
I | was | the president 
Barack Obama | is | the guy 
he | is | a good witness 
He | ca n't seal | the deal 
he | can push | it 
we | 're going to have | it
