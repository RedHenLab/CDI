I | do look forward | Thursday night 
We | 're going to talk | those new ideas 
I | 've never met | him 
I | 've been hearing | his Senate speeches 
Palin today | said | she 
she | 's now casting | the choice 
she | told | Katie Couric 
you | have | a 72-year-old running mate 
Joe Biden's | been | a while 
it | is | nothing 
He | 's got | a lot of experience 
we | 've been hearing | his speeches 
he | 's got | a tremendous amount of experience 
I | 'm | the new energy 
he | 's got | the experience 
Palin | was asked | what materials 
she | red | that 
I | want to show | our viewers 
magazines | did | you 
you | were tapped | this 
I | read | most of them 
I | 'm | curious 
that | have been | front of me 
you | name | some ? 
I | have | a vast variety of sources 
we | get | our news 
Alaska | is | a foreign country 
it | is | kind of suggested 
you | keep | touch 
you | live up there | Alaska 
they | 're | coaching 
they | need to let | Palin 
She | could n't actually name | any magazine or newspaper 
it | is just | sort 
I | do n't think | it 
I | think | her 
the media | looks | Alaska 
some third-world nation | does n't have | access 
She | was just asking | her 
It | is | a question 
I | 've been asked | a million times 
you | think | it 
She | could have answered | it 
she | answered | the question 
she | reads | different magazines and newspapers 
I | believe | she 
I | do n't think | it 
She | said | all of them 
I | think | she 
she | has | access 
that | 's put | front of her 
Palin | is not being allowed to be | Palin 
I | think | she 
we | were listening | to 
I | think | that 
That | was | the real Sarah Palin 
it | has | nothing 
Alaska | has | the Internet 
You | can read | anything 
She | can read | anything 
we | have heard and seen | Governor Palin 
she | is | a woman 
She | may know | a lot 
She | may know | a lot 
moose hunting or fishing | even governing | Alaska 
she | has | no interest 
She | did n't have | a passport 
she | was | 47 
She | has | no interest 
I | think | that 
you | can live | Alaska 
you | get | it 
you | know | what 
people | responded | her 
It | is | she 
She | does understand | what 
she | 's lived | their challenges 
she | has | no interests 
her interests | are | the same 
Washington | does not mean | she 
she | did | two short years 
She | focused | the issues 
that | were | concern 
she | turned | things 
she | was asked | the surge 
she | said | she 
the news | did n't really have much | an opinion 
that | concern | you 
someone | had asked | you 
you | could have formed | an opinion 
I | 'm | you 
I | 'm | I 
I | do | this 
I | read | the issues 
I | have | strong opinions 
I | come | CNN 
I | express | them 
that | 's | what 
she | did | a living 
She | was | commander 
she | did | Alaska 
she | has | those real natural leadership skills 
us | show | our viewers 
Katie Couric | asked | Palin 
I | 'm | all 
I | 'm all | any preventative measures 
I | am | one 
that life | starts | the moment of conception 
you | do n't believe | the morning 
I | would like to see | fewer and fewer abortions 
I | have n't spoken | anyone 
who | disagrees | my position 
I | want to ask | you 
you | condone or condemn | the morning 
this | is | a McCain-Palin policy 
I | 'm just asking | you 
I | would not choose to participate | that kind of contraception 
She | 's clearly been | a bonus 
terms | energizing | the base 
she | helping winning | moderates and women 
I | think | the question 
she | would take | a morning 
she | would prohibit | other women 
I | heard | an answer 
you | know | what 
her position | is | president of the United States 
she | oppose to allow | women 
She | 's opposed | all abortion 
she | believes | life 
she | is opposed | it 
That | is | a very public position 
you | think | people 
there | is | no question 
they | 're underestimating | her 
we | saw | the convention 
I | 've seen | tapes of her 
she | was chosen | a governor 
she | has been | handled 
She | has been pumped | facts and figures 
who | is | a great natural communicator 
You | lose | your spontaneity 
which | is | what 
he | lost | his first debate 
They | pumped | him 
I | remember | one Republican once famous 
I | have | my mind 
you | 'd better not confuse | her 
You | 're so much | that 
you | need | a few facts 
people | give | the sense of that 
you | know | what 
you | speak | your heart 
You | do n't speak | your mind 
you | want to reach | American people 
That | is | what 
Ronald Reagan | could tell | story 
people | came | him 
they | knew | he 
You | do n't throw | facts and figures 
Policy wonks | make | lousy candidates 
It | 's | me 
Reagan | thought | a lot 
He | was | twice governor of the largest state 
He | 'd come | two delegates 
He | was | a man 
who | was supremely | public policy 
He | was interested | the world 
I | did n't agree | him 
Sarah Palin | showed | no interest 
it | is | you 
that | is | my single problem 
It | 's | a person 
I | think | she 
It | is | your ability 
she | 's born | that 
she | 's shown | it 
she | goes | against much 
she | is and takes | them 
You | name | one person 
Obama or Biden | have taken | face 
You | name | one 
I | would say | he 
he | took | on Hillary Clinton 
who | is | a minor figure 
I | 'm talking | an issue 
I | 'm talking | an issue 
You | asked | me 
That | was | himself 
you | said | who 
it | comes | himself 
it | comes | himself 
he | knows | a lot of facts and figures 
Professors | are | lousy candidates 
We | 're going to have to leave | it 
two | should be debating | Thursday night 
It | is | those two 
Sarah Palin | has made | headlines 
you | can see | Russia 
we | 'll show | you 
We | 're going to take | you 
that | is | just two miles 
it | give | Sarah Palin 
We | 'll ask | some of the 150 or so people 
who | live | there what
