I | was | a member of that family 
I | have | some very cherished memories of those times 
There | was | a lot of good times 
I | do n't wish | any ill will 
That | was | a CNN exclusive 
who | was | the center of an investigation 
there | is | breaking news 
Alaska's attorney general | says | state employees 
subpoenas | to give | evidence 
the state legislator | is leading | the probe 
the McCain campaign | is stepping | new charges 
What | was once | an ugly divorce 
Sarah Palin's sister | is now | the center of a political showdown 
The question | is | this 
any of her staff | put | pressure 
the state's top cop | to fire | the governor's ex-brother-in- law 
An investigator | hired | Alaska lawmakers 
He | 's made | many comments 
it | appeared | the DPS 
He | wanted | him 
I | 'm hoping | the subpoena 
me | to interview | him 
Republican lawmakers | say | the investigation 
They | call | it 
It | is already | a distraction 
Five state lawmakers | have sued to block | the investigation 
The McCain campaign | says | it 
Trooper Wooten | threatened | them 
Wooten | denies | that 
Palin | conceded | her staff 
The state trooper | has threatened to kill | my dad 
she | insists | governor 
she | did not pressure | anyone 
She | told | ABC 
her husband | had met | Monegan 
him | to fire | Wooten 
who | was making | threats 
the McCain campaign | says | Sarah Palin 
Todd Palin | met | Monegan 
she | became | governor 
Monegan | insists | he 
he | did n't sack | the trooper 
He | says | he 
I | believe | I 
I | did not fire | Mike Wooten 
The McCain campaign | is now providing | dozens of e-mails 
it | says | show Monegan 
The final straw | came | June 
Commissioner Monegan | arranged | yet another unauthorized trip 
Washington D.C. | to request | more financial assistance 
Alaska | say | Monegan's firing 
They | include | a former U.S. attorney 
who | was | an informal ethics advisor 
this letter | dated | July 24 
Wesley Shay ( ph | ) told | Sarah Palin 
he | had | grave concern 
she | received | the Monegan case 
He | declined to speak | camera 
they | would have done | what 
I | think | it 
the governor | told | us 
we | ca n't always act | every idea 
We | continue to look | all the candidates 
49 days | to go | this election 
Pizza | delivered | the ground 
He | picks | it 
We | 'll show | you 
it | means | you 
you | should do | your money
