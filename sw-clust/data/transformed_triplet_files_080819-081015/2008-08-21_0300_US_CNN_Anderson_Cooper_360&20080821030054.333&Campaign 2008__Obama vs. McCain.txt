We | begin | Barack Obama 
you | mean | super size 
Senator Obama | says | he 
he | have | an answer 
He | 'd | he 
the Democrats | is how | one veteran party strategist 
if | to prove | that point 
the latest nationwide CNN poll of polls | shows | a one-point Obama advantage 
the board | tightening | the race 
some polling | even showing | a McCain lead 
it | worry | the Democrats 
it | worry | the Obama forces 
they | seem to be turning | the heat 
which | tells | you 
Barack Obama | promised to practice | a different kind of politics 
he | 's largely avoided | direct attacks 
they | do n't have | any new ideas 
That | is why | they 
all their time | talking | me 
Barack Obama | is taking | aim 
He | wants to continue | the same economic policies 
George Bush | has been doing | the last eight years 
I | honor | his service 
I | do n't honor | his policies 
he | is | his opponent 
that Senator McCain | picks | his positions 
I | 've not suggested | it 
I | believe | he 
it | is | time 
him | to acknowledge | I 
I | will let | no one question 
John McCain | making | dishonest and desperate attacks 
The Obama campaign | insists | the sharpened tone 
what | happens when | a general election 
Obama | was drawn | this fight 
McCain | spent | weeks 
McCain | has managed to almost eliminate | Obama's lead 
the Obama campaign | is trying to change | the topic 
John McCain | supports | Bush's tax cuts 
we | afford | more of the same 
They | dismiss | the attacks 
they | wanted to stay | the fray 
he | knows | he 
Obama | joked | Democrats 
I | try to explain | people 
I | 'm | Chicago 
he | 's promising | a spirited fight 
John McCain | does n't know | what 
he | is up | right 
I | do n't intend to lose | this election 
Obama | steps | his attacks 
we | 're going to talk | a bit 
We | 're expecting | Senator Obama 
you | 'd signed | the text message 
Senator McCain | may be trying to steal | his thunder 
Al Gore's running mate Joe Lieberman | join | the Republican ticket 
> > | ED | HENRY 
John McCain's decision | to put | Joe Lieberman front and center 
his convention | has | the unique distinction of unsettling both Democrats and Republicans 
( R ) | > | > PRESUMPTIVE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE 
I | say | Joe Lieberman 
Democrats | are | furious Lieberman 
fearful this | is | one of many signs McCain 
who | supports | abortion rights 
you | going to pick | a vice president 
conservatives | can actually rally around | the future 
you | going to give | us 
who | will cause | us 
McCain | was pressed | the matter 
I | will nominate | a person 
who | shares | my principles 
that | is | the best 
I | can tell | you 
I | said | Saturday night 
I | have | a proud pro-life record 
I | am | that 
I | respect | the views of others 
Saturday | was | the Faith Forum 
McCain | won | raves 
conservatives | speaking | abortion 
the right | is now bluntly warning | McCain 
he | will wipe out | the goodwill 
he | selects | someone 
who | supports | abortion rights 
Veteran Activist Richard Viguerie | issued | an open letter 
one more time | choosing | a pro-abortion vice presidential candidate 
conservatives | will show | you 
two | can play | the maverick game 
There | is | chatter 
the Lieberman- Ridge trial balloon | has really just been | a smoke screen 
McCain | picks | Romney 
he | can address | any conservative concerns 
he | 's | Ridge 
He | can nominate or try to nominate | anybody 
it | would be | a very bumpy road 
a moderate | would be | a road 
which | is why | conservatives 
us | talk | strategy 
We | 've got | quite a bit 
I | 'm | the Arena 
you | 're | the Democrat 
Many Democrats | have | anguish 
Democrats | thought | they 
Obama | says | he 
He | says | he 
you | see | him 
I | think | he 
that | 's really | the issue 
I | think | the campaign 
I | think | the party 
Barack Obama | is going to be doing | the next two weeks 
I | hope | he 
we | 've now gotten | a good sense 
this party | is going to change | Washington 
he | gets | the issues 
the American people | agree | him 
that | is | what 
that | favor | folks 
Barack Obama | focuses | people's attention 
that | is where | people 
me | ask | you 
you | agree | that point 
We | were up | double digit 
the fundamentals | favor | us 
we | have | a dead heat 
you | said | the top of the program 
August | is | the cruelest month 
I | think | Obama 
One | is | he 
He | had to do | McCain 
what McCain | did | him 
he | did n't do | it 
The other | is | he 
He | is | change 
He | is | hope 
he | has n't been driving | home 
he | had | numerous opportunities 
he | chose to be | Rick Warren 
which | was | a good idea 
he | has | a message 
He | has n't been delivering | it 
you | watch | these newer Obama ads 
you | see | a tough Chicago street politician 
who | does n't like | this way of fighting 
That | is | the problem 
you | look | him 
you | see | both 
It | seems | a very conflicted campaign 
I | think | that 
You | saw | John McCain 
who | 's been | a while 
he | knows | who 
he | knows | what 
he | does n't have to think | what's important and true 
who | seemed very | caring and positive guy 
he | believes | who 
he | is | what's important 
I | think | that 
he | ca n't define | himself 
that | 's | solid and 
you | have | that experience 
you | have | that kind of lack 
I | think | people 
that | can sit | the Oval Office 
We | 'll have | more 
I | ask | all 
you | to standby more | panel 
you | can join | our conversation 
Just | go to ac360.com and follow | the links 
That | is where | you 
you | ca n't do | what George Bush 
I | looked | Vladimir Putin's soul 
You | do n't look | somebody's soul 
You | look | your national interests 
the Trail " today | talking | tougher 
you | name | it 
you | 've been saying | all 
Obama | needs to be | he 
I | think | he 
I | mean | President Bush 
it | might not be | a bad idea 
Obama | to remind | people 
I | want to come back | John McCain 
We | saw | Ed Henry's piece 
it | is | a head fake 
they | get | the end 
it | serve | John McCain 
that | does n't trust | him 
I | might pick | Tom Ridge 
who | supports | abortion rights 
I | might even pick | the guy 
who | was | Al Gore's running mate 
I | think | McCain 
he | 's looking | for vice president 
My guess | is | the old fighter pilot 
he | could be | the cockpit 
who | 'll keep | the country safe 
I | think | those people 
you | look | the other political considerations 
Ridge | passes | those tests 
Lieberman | passes | those tests 
Romney | passes | those tests 
those guys | have to be | the short list 
you | 're watching | this play 
you | 're watching | this play out 
Democrats | are already | a bit 
you | have | a very tight national race 
you | worry | that McCain 
his own convention | pick | somebody 
who | supports | abortion rights 
No. John McCain | has changed | his mind 
every single issue | to win | this nomination 
He | 's changed | it 
He | 's changed | it 
He | 's changed | it 
He | 's gone kissing | the ring of the right wing 
he | said | he 
There | is | no way 
he | 's going to flip | that 
He | wants to get elected | his base 
He | 's going to focus | somebody 
I | think | he 
he | made | that decision 
who | supports | abortion rights 
the party | would support | him 
he | is | their nominee 
you | believe | that 
I | think | the party 
I | was listening | Alex 
experience and predictable John McCain | was | a little while 
that | accused | Jerry Falwell 
Pat Robertson | being | agents of intolerance 
I | mean | this guy 
he | loves to live | his comfort zone 
Joe Lieberman | is | a crucial part of his posse 
I | do n't think | he 
it | is | John McCain 
he | trying to remind | the Republicans 
he | picks | someone 
who | is | he 
he | trying to tell | the party 
we | 've been | sort of poking 
I | 'm | charge 
I | think obviously | that 
one of the perks | being | the nominee 
You | get to do | that 
also Lieberman | is | a slightly safer choice 
you | 're not putting | him 
him | up | the heir 
you | would be putting | him 
I | think actually | Lieberman 
there | is | one big issue 
that | dominates Republicans now | unites everybody 
it | is keeping | the country safe 
somebody | is trying to break | your house 
you | 're going to worry | other issues 
I | think | the ticket 
I | enjoy | conventions 
I | enjoy | one 
Joe Klein | will be | us
