that | could affect | your job 
the mortgage crisis | is | yet 
that | would be | a nightmare 
What | is | AIG 
what | does it mean | everyone 
AIG | is | one of the largest insurers 
They | has | more than 70 million customers 
those | are | individuals and companies 
This | is | Lehman Brothers 
This | is | Freddie and Fannie 
It | is tied | so much 
AIG | has been trying | more 
a week | to raise | $ 75 million 
It | has found | it 
the government | has extended | AIG 
It | is | a temporary loan 
it | comes | a rate 
which | is calculated | today's rates 
they | can use | this 
that | is | a very 
which | means | the government 
there | is | no incentive 
AIG | lives to fight | another day 
that | means | your stocks 
it | is | part of the Dow 30 
It | is | one of the biggest companies 
I | want to read | you 
who | sits | the Senate Finance Committee 
The administration | is approaching | an unprecedented step 
we | are living | unprecedented times 
you | have to stop and catch | your breath 
the government | bailing | them 
it | is | a huge company 
It | touches | all parts of the economy 
You | look | Wall Street 
it | does n't really matter | another investment company 
People | are out | work 
it | does n't have | the same ripple effect 
I | think | the most important of AIG 
it | is | the linchpin of a lot 
It | insures | property casualty 
It | has | life insurance 
You | ca n't let | this company 
It | had | $ 110 billion 
many bailouts | can | our government 
AIG | > | VELSHI 
It | is | a lot of money 
that | is | taxpayer money 
the government | wants to be | they 
they | are charging | a lot 
this loan | to discourage | anybody else 
who | wants to come looking | money 
what | is | better 
the money | deal | the cleanup 
this | is | what 
you | 're going to hear | a lot of talk 
the government | doing | that 
There | are | some people 
who | are going to say | they 
they | saved | a bad situation 
there | are | others 
who | are going to say | we 
the government | ca n't be | this business 
who | get | trouble 
this | > | BRADY 
I | think | they 
I | think | an important thing 
us | remember | they 
They | did not want to do | this 
There | is | no money 
They | tried | Wall Street 
There | is | no money 
They | tried to bend | the insurance rules 
there | are | others 
WaMu | could come | the line 
we | will talk | you 
Personal finance expert Suze Orman | joins | us 
you | should and should n't be doing | your stocks

health care | caused | a crisis 
( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ) | > | > MCCAIN 
We | 're going to put | a stop 
( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ) | > | > MCCAIN 
I | pledge | the FDIC 
the SBIC | will have | all the support 
they | need to fully back | the savings of the American people 
Government | has | a clear responsibility 
that | is exactly | what 
I | promise | reforms

That | was | John McCain

We | need to replace | Fannie Mae 
we | know | them 
I | will ease | the burden 
I | will change | our bankruptcy laws 
families | to stay | their homes 
Sarah Palin | joined | John McCain 
That | is where | Ed Henry 
> > | ED | HENRY 
there | are | empty seats 
Palin | was finished speaking here | Ohio 
McCain | was still | the podium 
It | is | the second 
command | to outshine | the top of the ticket 
McCain aides | insist | they 
it | boosts | their megaphone 
We | need | serious reform 
John McCain | is | the guy 
who | will get | it 
( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ) | > | > MCCAIN 
We | 're going to put | an end 
that | have caused | a crisis 
they | are running | outsiders 
we | are going | Washington 
( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ) | > | > HENRY 
McCain's latest solution | to fix | the economy 
Washington | to probe | Wall Street 
We | have to assure | every American 
We | have to have | a Commission 
we | have to fix | this alphabet soup of regulatory agencies 
that | is left | over 
Barack Obama | jumped | all 
Senator McCain | offered | the oldest Washington stunt 
You | pass | the buck 
a commission | to study | the problem 
they | can paint | McCain 
all voters | are going to kick | the tires 
they | 're going to figure | these policies 
Democrats | are doing | some wishful thinking 
I | think | it 
the Democratic Party | is | full-throated panic 
even some conservatives | see | a risk 
it | becomes | a 
you | 're relying too much | your vice president 
you | do n't have | that ability 
the McCain campaign | concerned | all these attacks 
their surrogates | are having | an impact 
they | say | they 
there | are | signals 
the campaign | may be sending | Governor Palin 
That | would give | her 
that | is | a sign 
they | 're | that hole 
this | would be | one way 
that | will have | a 
Barack Obama | sees | an opening 
a way | to connect | Main Street 
We | are | the most serious financial crisis 
Senator McCain | stood | yesterday 
McCain | said | he 
It | is | the Obama campaign's favorite line 
Obama | offered | what 
he | called | six principles 
commercial banks and thrift institutions | were | guidelines 
that | did not apply | mortgage brokers and companies 
This regulatory framework | failed to protect | homeowners 
McCain | has also called | better oversight and regulation 
I | 'm always | less regulation 
this | is | what 
you | confuse | the free market 
a free license | to let | special interests 
McCain | is | a tool 
special interests | is | a recurrent theme 
this | is | a two-man race 
the facts | tell | a different story 
Senator Obama | took | more money 
they | answer | to 
( AUDIENCE BOOING ) | > | > MCCAIN 
he | put | Fannie Mae's CEO 
who | helped create | this problem 
charge | finding | his vice president 
( AUDIENCE BOOING ) | > | > MCCAIN 
That | 's | change 
That | is | what 
It | is | word-to-word combat 
Obama's high-flying rhetoric | is | all but gone 
It | is | bolts 
he | tries to connect | this reluctant voting bloc 
These | are | the struggles 
This | is | the pain 
this race | is decided | the economy 
Candy | joins | us 
Obama | has had | trouble 
he | is making | progress 
people | have not been paying | that much attention 
They | believe | Obama 
people | see | him 
they | understand | he 
They | think | the debates 
him | show | his connection 
they | are going to see | Obama 
that | understands | paycheck-to-paycheck workers 
they | -- | they 
that | is | the way 
they | will see | him 
We | are going to talk | you 
about more of what | is happening | the trail 
we | 're blogging | the hour
