What | is | AIG 
what | does it mean | everyone 
AIG | is | one of the largest insurers 
They | has | more than 70 million customers 
those | are | individuals and companies 
This | is | Lehman Brothers 
This | is | Freddie and Fannie 
It | is tied | so much 
AIG | has been trying | more 
a week | to raise | $ 75 million 
It | has found | it 
the government | has extended | AIG 
It | is | a temporary loan 
it | comes | a rate 
which | is calculated | today's rates 
they | can use | this 
that | is | a very 
which | means | the government 
there | is | no incentive 
AIG | lives to fight | another day 
that | means | your stocks 
it | is | part of the Dow 30 
It | is | one of the biggest companies 
I | want to read | you 
who | sits | the Senate Finance Committee 
The administration | is approaching | an unprecedented step 
we | are living | unprecedented times 
you | have to stop and catch | your breath 
the government | bailing | them 
it | is | a huge company 
It | touches | all parts of the economy 
You | look | Wall Street 
it | does n't really matter | another investment company 
People | are out | work 
it | does n't have | the same ripple effect 
I | think | the most important of AIG 
it | is | the linchpin of a lot 
It | insures | property casualty 
It | has | life insurance 
You | ca n't let | this company 
It | had | $ 110 billion 
many bailouts | can | our government 
AIG | > | VELSHI 
It | is | a lot of money 
that | is | taxpayer money 
the government | wants to be | they 
they | are charging | a lot 
this loan | to discourage | anybody else 
who | wants to come looking | money 
what | is | better 
the money | deal | the cleanup 
this | is | what 
you | 're going to hear | a lot of talk 
the government | doing | that 
There | are | some people 
who | are going to say | they 
they | saved | a bad situation 
there | are | others 
who | are going to say | we 
the government | ca n't be | this business 
who | get | trouble 
this | > | BRADY 
I | think | they 
I | think | an important thing 
us | remember | they 
They | did not want to do | this 
There | is | no money 
They | tried | Wall Street 
There | is | no money 
They | tried to bend | the insurance rules 
there | are | others 
WaMu | could come | the line
